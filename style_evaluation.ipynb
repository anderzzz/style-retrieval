    "# Style Instruction Evaluation Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook evaluates how well derived style instructions enable style replication, compared to alternative approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "For each gold standard text:\n",
    "1. **Flatten**: Extract content while removing style\n",
    "2. **Reconstruct**: Generate text using 4 different methods (M stochastic runs each):\n",
    "   - Generic baseline\n",
    "   - Few-shot learning\n",
    "   - Author name prompting\n",
    "   - Derived style instructions\n",
    "3. **Judge (Blind Comparative)**: Judge ranks all 4 reconstructions from 1-4 based on similarity to original\n",
    "   - **Blind evaluation**: Judge sees only anonymous labels (Text A, B, C, D) - no method names\n",
    "   - **Ranking**: 1 = most similar, 2 = second, 3 = third, 4 = least similar\n",
    "   - **Order randomized**: Position of methods varies across samples to eliminate bias\n",
    "4. **Aggregate**: Analyze rankings to determine which method best captures style\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Crash resilient**: All LLM responses saved to SQLite immediately\n",
    "- **Resume support**: Can restart after failures, skips completed work\n",
    "- **Blind evaluation**: Eliminates judge bias by hiding method names\n",
    "- **Comparative ranking**: More informative than binary comparisons"

      "- This chapter focuses exclusively on **knowledge of things**, which is further divided into two kinds:\n",
      "  - **Knowledge by acquaintance**\n",
      "  - **Knowledge by description**\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **2. Knowledge by Acquaintance**\n",
      "- **Definition**: Direct awareness of something without inference or reliance on knowledge of truths.\n",
      "- **Key Features**:\n",
      "  - Simpler than knowledge of truths.\n",
      "  - Logically independent of knowledge of truths (though in practice, humans rarely have acquaintance without also knowing some truth about the object).\n",
      "- **Example**:\n",
      "  - When perceiving a table, one is directly aware of its **sense-data** (color, shape, hardness, smoothness).\n",
      "  - These sense-data are immediately known as they are, without requiring further knowledge.\n",
      "  - Statements about the sense-data (e.g., \"the color is brown\") provide knowledge of truths but do not enhance direct acquaintance with the sense-data itself.\n",
      "  - Acquaintance with sense-data is complete and perfect upon direct perception; no additional knowledge of the sense-data is theoretically possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **3. Knowledge by Description**\n",
      "- **Definition**: Knowledge of something not directly perceived but known through a description that connects it to things with which we have acquaintance.\n",
      "- **Key Features**:\n",
      "  - Always depends on some knowledge of truths as its foundation.\n",
      "  - Does not involve direct awareness of the object itself.\n",
      "- **Example**:\n",
      "  - Knowledge of a table as a physical object is **not direct**.\n",
      "  - It is derived from acquaintance with sense-data (appearance of the table).\n",
      "  - The table is known as **\"the physical object that causes such-and-such sense-data.\"**\n",
      "  - To know anything about the table, one must know truths linking it to sense-data (e.g., \"these sense-data are caused by a physical object\").\n",
      "  - The table itself is not directly known; only a description of it is known, along with the fact that one unique object corresponds to that description.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **4. Contrast Between Acquaintance and Description**\n",
      "- **Acquaintance**:\n",
      "  - Direct, immediate, and complete.\n",

      "  - Requires inference or knowledge of truths to connect the described object to things with which we have acquaintance.\n",
      "  - Example: The table as a physical object.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **5. Foundational Role of Acquaintance**\n",
      "- All knowledge (of things and truths) ultimately depends on acquaintance.\n",
      "- **Types of Things with Which We Have Acquaintance**:\n",
      "  - **Sense-data**:\n",
      "    - Most obvious example of acquaintance.\n",
      "    - If sense-data were the only objects of acquaintance, knowledge would be severely limited.\n",
      "    - We would only know what is immediately present to the senses.\n",
      "    - Could not know:\n",
      "      - The past (or even that a past exists).\n",
      "      - Truths about sense-data themselves.\n",
      "  - **Universals (Abstract Ideas)**:\n",
      "    - Knowledge of truths requires acquaintance with universals (e.g., abstract concepts, relations).\n",
      "    - Universals are fundamentally different from sense-data.\n",
      "    - Necessary for a full analysis of knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **6. Emphasis and Qualification**\n",
      "- **Emphasis on Directness**:\n",
      "  - Acquaintance is **direct** and **immediate**, unlike description.\n",
      "  - No further knowledge of an object of acquaintance is possible beyond direct perception.\n",
      "- **Qualification on Human Knowledge**:\n",
      "  - While acquaintance is logically independent of knowledge of truths, humans rarely (if ever) have acquaintance without also knowing some truth about the object.\n",
      "- **Contrast in Certainty**:\n",
      "  - Sense-data (objects of acquaintance) cannot be doubted.\n",
      "  - The existence of the table (known by description) can be doubted.\n",
      "- **Scope of Knowledge**:\n",
      "  - Sense-data alone are insufficient for a complete account of knowledge.\n",

      "Moscow is neither the hell of foreign caricature nor the heaven of socialist fantasy\u2014yet it is both, and neither. The Northcliffe Press paints a city drowning in chaos, its streets a riot of suffering, while young Socialists hymn a workers\u2019 utopia where prosperity flows like water. The truth, as ever, lurks in the shadows between. Step from the station into the morning light, and you will find no anarchy, no paradise\u2014only the quiet rhythm of a society straining against its own contradictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Order here is not the absence of disorder but its careful containment. Crime is a whisper, not a scream; the streets, for those who steer clear of politics, are safer than the boulevards of Paris or the alleys of New York. The theatres hum with the same old magic\u2014*Swan Lake* pirouettes on, *Boris Godunov* thunders\u2014some seats sold for kopeks, others gifted to the unions. Drunkenness, that scourge of the old regime, has all but vanished; in its place, a sober industriousness, as if the city itself has sworn off vodka. Prostitutes, those spectral figures of other capitals, are rare as snow in July. Women move through the crowds unmolested, a freedom so absolute it feels like a revolution of its own. This is not the Moscow of propaganda, but neither is it a city without cost. The order is real, the virtue undeniable\u2014yet it is a virtue forged in steel, not in song.\n",
      "\n",
      "The educated do not idle. They work, and work hard, their days measured in ledgers and lesson plans, in decrees and directives. A clerk\u2019s pen scratches until dusk; a teacher\u2019s voice rasps through a third lecture of the afternoon. Government offices hum with the clatter of typewriters, their occupants bent over desks like monks over scripture. Not all roles are noble, not all labor fulfilling\u2014but all are filled. The state has no patience for the unemployed intellectual. If you are literate, you will be put to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the order comes at a cost, and the cost is paid in hunger. The war and the blockade have hollowed out the larder; bread is rationed, meat a memory. No need to dwell on the details\u2014everyone knows them, everyone lives them. The real toll is not in the stomach but in the hours stolen from life. The eight-hour day was a promise, a fleeting one; now the factories demand ten, twelve, the clock stretched thin as a beggar\u2019s patience. And still it is not enough. Wages buy little, so workers take on extra shifts, unpaid, unrecorded, a second shadow cast by the first. The government did not invent this hunger, but it does not relieve it either. The war is to blame, the blockade is to blame\u2014but blame, like bread, is in short supply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dusk falls, and the city exhales. The streets fill not with revelers but with pilgrims: men and women in threadbare coats, their arms laden with bundles, their hands clutching tin cans like sacred vessels. They move in silence, a procession of exhaustion, their faces etched with the day\u2019s labor and the night\u2019s errands. Water must be fetched, food bartered, permits renewed. The grand avenues, once choked with carriages, now stretch empty, a capital reduced to village scale. The trams groan under their loads, the sidewalks echo with the clatter of wooden soles. Moscow is still a metropolis\u2014but a metropolis that has learned to do without.\n",
      "\n",
      "To leave the city is to embark on an odyssey. A permit is required, and permits are not given; they are wrested from the bureaucracy, a scrap of paper signed in triplicate, stamped with the seal of necessity. Days are lost in queues, in offices, in the slow grind of officialdom. And then, if you are lucky, a seat\u2014though seat is a generous word. The trains are cattle cars, bodies packed so tight the air turns thick with breath and sweat. On the roofs, on the buffers, clinging to the sides like barnacles, the desperate ride the rails, their faces turned toward the countryside not for leisure but for survival. There are no holidays here, no spontaneous escapes. Travel is for the starving, for the connected, for those with relatives to shelter them. The state owns the hotels, and the police decide who sleeps in them. To move is to ask permission; to rest is a privilege.\n",
      "\n",
      "The police are everywhere, their presence as constant as the cold. Not since Prussia\u2019s anti-Socialist campaigns has a state so thoroughly blurred the line between guardian and jailer. At the stations, they search for \u201cspeculation\u201d\u2014a loaf of bread, a sack of potatoes, the contraband of the hungry. Nearly everyone breaks the law daily, and no one knows who might be watching. The Extraordinary Commission\u2019s spies are legion, their informants hidden in plain sight. Even in the prisons, they linger among the inmates, half-free, half-feared, their whispers buying privileges, their silence buying survival. Trust is a luxury; paranoia, a survival skill.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moscow\u2019s trials are not merely of the body but of the soul. The hunger gnaws, the work exhausts\u2014but it is the weight of the system that crushes. Permits, searches, spies: the machinery of control grinds on, its gears oiled by suspicion. The war explains the shortages, the blockade the rationing\u2014but who explains the permits, the queues, the ever-present eye of the state? Some burdens are imposed by history; others are chosen. And in the space between, a city learns to live not as it wishes, but as it must.\n",

      "It is a curious fact, and one not without its philosophical significance, that the human mind, when confronted with the unfamiliar, inclines toward the extremes of judgment. So it has been with Moscow. To the one side, we have the shrill denunciations of the Northcliffe press, which would have us believe that the city is a howling wilderness of anarchy, where men starve in the streets and virtue has fled the earth. To the other, we have the starry-eyed enthusiasm of young Socialists, who, in their zeal for the new order, imagine a terrestrial paradise where labor is light, bread is plentiful, and the lion lies down with the lamb. Both visions, I need hardly say, are the products of fantasy rather than observation. The truth, as is so often the case, lies in the uncomfortable middle ground\u2014a place where neither despair nor rapture is justified, but where a sober assessment must acknowledge both the achievements and the failures of the present experiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us begin, then, with what is undeniable: Moscow is not a city in chaos. The streets, though worn and weary, are not scenes of riot or disorder. Crime, that perennial companion of urban life, has been reduced to a shadow of its former self. The theatres, those temples of civilized leisure, continue their performances much as they did before the revolution\u2014indeed, one might argue that they do so with greater earnestness, for the Bolsheviks, whatever their other faults, have not neglected the arts. The opera and ballet, those most refined of Russian traditions, proceed with their accustomed splendor, though now the seats are filled not only by the paying public but by the representatives of the trade unions, who attend as a matter of right rather than privilege. Drunkenness, that scourge of the old regime, is now a rarity; in the course of my stay, I observed not a single intoxicated man, a circumstance so remarkable that it would be cause for astonishment in any European capital. Prostitution, too, has all but vanished\u2014a fact which, when one considers the economic pressures that once drove women to such desperate measures, speaks either to the efficacy of the new order or to the severity of its alternatives. And as for the treatment of women in public spaces, I can say with confidence that nowhere in the world\u2014not in London, not in Paris, not even in the most enlightened corners of America\u2014are they subjected to less molestation than in Moscow. The streets, in short, present an aspect of order, industry, and even virtue that would do credit to a Puritan settlement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet if the surface of life in Moscow is one of discipline and decorum, the substance is far less reassuring. For beneath this veneer of public rectitude lies a reality of privation and toil that few in the West can truly comprehend. The most immediate and pressing of these hardships is, of course, the scarcity of food\u2014a fact so widely acknowledged that it scarcely requires elaboration. But it is not merely the lack of sustenance that weighs upon the people; it is the manner in which their labor is exacted. The eight-hour workday, that great triumph of socialist theory, has in practice been extended to ten hours in many industries, and even this is not the end of the matter. For the wages paid by the state are so meager that they scarcely suffice to keep body and soul together, and thus the worker, having already given his ten hours to the factory, must then devote himself to additional, unpaid labor\u2014whether in the form of petty trade, clandestine agriculture, or the endless quest for the necessities of life. This, I should hasten to add, is not the result of any deliberate cruelty on the part of the government, but rather the inevitable consequence of war and blockade, which have left the country in a state of economic asphyxiation. Still, the effect is the same: the people of Moscow, particularly the educated classes, who have found employment in the bureaucracy or the schools, work with a relentless industry that would put the most zealous of Victorian factory hands to shame.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what becomes of them when their labors are done? The answer is simple: they set about the business of survival. The streets, which by day are the domain of the worker hurrying to and from his post, are by evening transformed into a procession of weary figures, each bearing the tools of his private struggle\u2014a bundle of firewood, a tin can of water, the meager fruits of a day\u2019s bartering. The city, once the glittering heart of an empire, now has the air of a vast and overgrown village, its grand boulevards empty of traffic, its people scattered in their individual pursuits. There are no holidays, no respite from the grind of daily existence. Travel, that most elementary of freedoms, has been rendered nearly impossible for all but the most determined\u2014or the most privileged. To board a train, one must first obtain a permit, a document granted only for the most pressing of reasons, and even then, the process is a trial of patience and endurance. Days may be spent in queues, pleading one\u2019s case before indifferent officials, only to find, upon securing a seat, that the carriage is so crowded that passengers are forced to ride upon the roofs, or cling to the sides like barnacles upon a ship\u2019s hull. And what is the purpose of such journeys? Not pleasure, certainly, nor even the simple desire for change of scene. No, the people of Moscow travel only when necessity compels them\u2014when they must visit relatives in the countryside in the hope of procuring food, or when some official errand demands their presence in another town. For the hotels, like everything else, are under state control, and one may not so much as rent a room without the sanction of the police.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah, the police! Here, at last, we come to the most disquieting aspect of life in Moscow\u2014the omnipresence of the state in the most intimate affairs of its citizens. It is not merely that the police are numerous, or that their powers are vast; it is that their influence extends into every corner of existence, so that no man can be certain who among his acquaintances is an informer, or what trivial infraction might bring him to the attention of the Extraordinary Commission. The law, in its infinite wisdom, has made criminals of nearly everyone, for who among us has not, at some point, engaged in \"speculation\"\u2014that is, the buying and selling of goods without the express permission of the authorities? The traveler returning from the countryside with a sack of potatoes is a smuggler; the housewife who trades a pair of shoes for a loaf of bread is a black marketeer. And so the police search, and the people tremble, and the prisons, we are told, are filled with spies who report on their fellow inmates in exchange for small privileges. It is a system that would have done credit to the most paranoid of Tsarist regimes, and one that casts a pall over even the most innocent of social interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet\u2014here, as elsewhere, we must resist the temptation to oversimplify. For if the Bolsheviks have failed in many respects, they have succeeded in others. The streets are safe, the arts flourish, and the people, though weary, are not broken. The hardships they endure are not, for the most part, the result of malice, but of circumstance\u2014a war that has drained the country of its resources, a blockade that has cut it off from the world, a revolution that has upended every established norm. The question, then, is not whether the present order is perfect\u2014it is manifestly not\u2014but whether, given the alternatives, it is preferable to the chaos that preceded it. This, I confess, is a question to which I have no ready answer. For while it is easy to condemn the excesses of the regime, it is far harder to imagine what might have taken their place. The old order is gone, and the new one, for all its flaws, has at least the virtue of existence. Whether it will endure, or whether it will collapse under the weight of its own contradictions, is a matter for the future to decide. In the meantime, we must content ourselves with observing, with as much clarity as we can muster, the strange and unsettling spectacle of a city that is at once a triumph of discipline and a monument to human suffering.\n",

      "Moscow, as it presents itself to the observer, defies the crude dichotomies by which it is so often judged. It is neither the apocalyptic ruin painted by the Northcliffe Press, nor the socialist Eden imagined by the more fervent of its young admirers. The truth, as ever, lies in the uneasy middle ground\u2014neither wholly disastrous nor entirely idyllic, but a city of sharp contrasts, where order and hardship exist side by side, each defining the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "To walk its streets is to move through a society that has, in many respects, achieved a kind of austere discipline. Crime is rare, and the streets, though quiet, are not lawless. The theatres, the opera, the ballet\u2014all endure, much as they did before, their performances attended by those who can pay and by trade unionists who enter without cost. Drunkenness, that perennial scourge of other capitals, is scarcely to be seen; prostitution, too, has dwindled to a shadow of its former self. Women move through the city with a freedom unknown elsewhere, unmolested, unharassed. The impression is one of a people industrious, even virtuous, their lives governed by a strict but not unkindly order.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet this order is purchased at a price. For all but the highest functionaries, life is a relentless struggle. The food shortages are too well known to require elaboration; they are the first and most pressing fact of existence. The eight-hour workday, once a proud achievement, has in many industries given way to ten, and even then, the wages are barely enough to sustain a man. Unpaid labor is the unspoken rule, not because the government demands it, but because necessity does. The educated, at least, have found their place\u2014clerks in government offices, teachers, administrators\u2014but for the rest, the days are long, the work hard, and the rewards meager.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then there is the business of living itself. After the day\u2019s labor, the real work begins: the standing in queues, the bartering, the endless search for the means of survival. The streets, once thronged, now have the air of a vast village, the few who pass by moving with the slow, burdened gait of those who carry not just their own weight, but the weight of a city\u2019s hunger. Their clothes are shabby, their faces drawn; they clutch at tin cans and bundles, not for show, but because these are the tools of their daily commerce.\n",
      "\n",
      "Travel, that simplest of pleasures, has become an ordeal. To leave Moscow is to submit to a bureaucracy as rigid as it is arbitrary. A permit is required, and permits are granted only for the most pressing of reasons. The process is slow, the waits interminable; days may pass before a seat is secured, and even then, the journey is no easy thing. The trains, when they come, are packed beyond imagining\u2014more crowded than the worst of London\u2019s rush hours, with passengers clinging to roofs, to buffers, to the very sides of the carriages. There are no holidays, no idle excursions; those who travel do so out of necessity, to visit relatives in the countryside, to scavenge for food. The hotels, state-controlled and policed, admit only those with the proper papers, the proper business. Spontaneity is a luxury no one can afford.\n",
      "\n",
      "And always, the shadow of the police. They are everywhere, more pervasive than in the Prussia of old, more intrusive than in the darkest days of the anti-Socialist laws. Every traveler is searched, every bundle inspected for signs of \"speculation\"\u2014that is, for food carried without permission. No one is above suspicion; no one knows who among their acquaintances might be an informer for the Extraordinary Commission. Even in the prisons, the spies are at work, mingling with the inmates, rewarded with privileges, though never with freedom. To live in Moscow is to live in a state of constant, low-level unease, where the law is both omnipresent and impossible to obey in full.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paradox, then, is this: a city of remarkable order, where crime is rare and culture endures, yet where the simplest acts of daily life\u2014eating, working, moving from one place to another\u2014have been transformed into trials of endurance. The government is not without its efficiencies; it has, in many ways, imposed a kind of ruthless competence. But the cost is high, and it is paid in the coin of human freedom. The war, the blockade\u2014these are the excuses, and they are not without merit. But the deeper truth is that Moscow has become a place where the state\u2019s reach extends into every corner of existence, where the individual is at once protected and constrained, where the price of order is a life lived at the edge of want.\n",

      "To walk the streets of Moscow in those years was to step into a world suspended between two extremes\u2014neither the apocalyptic wasteland of foreign caricature nor the socialist paradise of revolutionary propaganda. The truth, as ever, lay somewhere in the uneasy middle, where order and hardship, progress and privation, existed side by side in a tension that defined daily life.\n",
      "\n",
      "For all the chaos that outsiders imagined, Moscow was, in many ways, a city of surprising discipline. Crime was rare, and the streets, though worn, were not the lawless thoroughfares of sensationalist reports. Theatres and opera houses thrived, their stages still graced by the same world-class performances that had once drawn aristocrats and merchants alike. Now, however, the audience was a mix of the old intelligentsia and the new working class, some paying for their seats, others attending for free as members of trade unions. Drunkenness, that scourge of so many European capitals, had all but vanished\u2014sober faces and measured steps replaced the staggering crowds of pre-revolutionary nights. Even prostitution, that shadow of urban life, had receded to a fraction of its former presence. Women, in particular, moved through the city with a freedom unknown in Paris or London, unharassed by the catcalls and groping hands that plagued other great cities. The prevailing mood was one of industry, of a society straining not toward collapse, but toward something new\u2014however imperfect the attempt.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet, for all its order, Moscow was a city of relentless toil. The educated classes, once the idle beneficiaries of inherited wealth or patronage, now bent their backs in government offices, schools, and administrative posts, their skills repurposed for the machinery of the state. But it was the working class who bore the heaviest burden. The eight-hour workday, that hard-won victory of labor movements, had long since given way to ten-hour shifts in factories pressed by the demands of war and blockade. Worse still, the official wages were a cruel joke\u2014barely enough to keep body and soul together. To survive, workers took on unpaid overtime, bartered in the black market, or scavenged for scraps of food after their shifts. The streets, once clogged with carriages and motorcars, now echoed with the hollow clatter of tin cans and the weary shuffle of feet. Men and women, bundled in threadbare coats, carried their meager provisions home, their faces etched with exhaustion. Moscow had become a capital in name only, its grandeur reduced to the quiet desperation of a village.\n",
      "\n",
      "The greatest indignity, perhaps, was not the labor itself, but the sheer impossibility of escape. In other countries, even the poorest could dream of a holiday\u2014a train to the countryside, a night in a seaside boarding house, the brief respite of movement. In Moscow, such dreams were a luxury beyond reach. Travel was not a right but a privilege, granted only to those who could prove their journey necessary. Permits were required for even the shortest train ride, and securing one was an ordeal in itself: days spent in queues, forms stamped and restamped, bureaucrats who regarded every request with suspicion. Once obtained, the permit was no guarantee of passage. Trains, when they ran, were packed beyond capacity, their roofs and buffers clinging with passengers like ants on a sugar cube. Those who could not squeeze inside rode precariously on the sides, risking frostbite in winter and heatstroke in summer. And for what? Not leisure, not adventure, but the grim necessity of survival. Most traveled only to beg food from relatives in the countryside, or to barter what little they had for a sack of potatoes. Hotels, now state-controlled, turned away all but the most well-connected, their doors guarded by police who demanded proof of official business. Spontaneity had been erased from life; even the simplest pleasure\u2014a weekend away, a visit to a friend\u2014was now a bureaucratic gauntlet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Worst of all was the creeping sense that one was never truly alone. The police were everywhere, not as the visible enforcers of old, but as an insidious presence, lurking in the shadows of daily life. Travelers were searched at stations, their bags rifled for contraband\u2014anything from a loaf of bread to a handful of sugar could be seized as \"speculation.\" But the real surveillance was more subtle, more pervasive. The Extraordinary Commission, that omniscient arm of the state, had eyes in every workplace, every apartment block, every prison cell. No one knew who among their neighbors, their colleagues, even their friends, might be an informer. The law was a net so finely woven that nearly everyone broke it in some small way\u2014carrying an extra ration, whispering a complaint, failing to report a \"suspicious\" remark. And so trust withered. Conversations grew guarded, friendships cautious. Even in the prisons, where one might expect solidarity among the condemned, spies moved among the inmates, offering scraps of privilege in exchange for names. The result was a society not just of hardship, but of isolation\u2014a city where no one dared speak freely, where every interaction carried the risk of betrayal.\n",
      "\n",
      "What, then, was the sum of Moscow\u2019s reality? It was a place of contradictions, where the virtues of order and industry were undermined by the crushing weight of scarcity and control. The government could boast of low crime and full employment, but it could not feed its people or grant them the simplest freedoms. The theatres still played to packed houses, but the audiences left not to caf\u00e9s and salons, but to queues for bread. The educated still taught and wrote, but their words were measured, their thoughts policed. Some of the city\u2019s struggles were not of its own making\u2014the war, the blockade, the legacy of centuries of inequality\u2014but others were self-inflicted, the bitter fruit of a system that mistook control for progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moscow was neither the hellscape of foreign propaganda nor the utopia of revolutionary fantasy. It was, instead, a city of endurance, where people carried on not because life was good, but because it was the only life they had. And in that endurance, there was a kind of defiance\u2014not the grand, heroic defiance of banners and barricades, but the quiet, stubborn defiance of those who wake each morning and do what must be done, even when the world seems determined to break them.\n",

      "\n",
      "**ORIGINAL VOICE CHARACTERISTICS:**\n",
      "The original has a distinctive philosophical voice that is:\n",
      "- Clear and pedagogical, but not overly formal or ornate\n",
      "- Direct and matter-of-fact in its explanations (\"We shall say that we have acquaintance...\")\n",
      "- Uses simple, concrete examples (the table and its sense-data)\n",
      "- Employs straightforward sentence structures with occasional complexity\n",
      "- Has a conversational quality despite being philosophical (\"But first of all we must make clear...\")\n",
      "- Uses parenthetical asides naturally (\"the things which are sometimes called 'abstract ideas', but which we shall call 'universals'\")\n",
      "- Builds arguments incrementally without excessive rhetorical flourish\n",
      "- The tone is explanatory and accessible, not grandiose\n",
      "\n",
      "**TEXT A ANALYSIS:**\n",
      "Text A opens with dramatic rhetorical flourishes: \"Knowledge does not come to us as a single, undifferentiated whole\u2014it fractures at its foundation into irreconcilable yet indispensable forms.\" This is much more literary and dramatic than the original's straightforward \"In the preceding chapter we saw that there are two sorts of knowledge.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The prose is consistently more elevated and stylized: \"the raw, unmediated grasp of objects, entities, the immediate presences that press upon our senses,\" \"the structured, propositional edifice of facts.\" The original would simply say \"knowledge of things\" and \"knowledge of truths.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Text A uses metaphors extensively (\"the scaffolding of propositions,\" \"the veil of description,\" \"the edifice of knowledge\") where the original uses plain language. The rhythm is more literary and self-consciously philosophical. Phrases like \"Yet this independence is more theoretical than practical. In the messy reality of human cognition...\" have a modern essay quality that differs from the original's more classical philosophical exposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "**TEXT B ANALYSIS:**\n",
      "Text B uses formal section headings (I, II, III, IV, V) and a highly structured, treatise-like format. The opening has an elaborate, Victorian-era philosophical style: \"The inquiry into the nature of knowledge, that most elusive and yet most indispensable of human possessions, must begin with a distinction of the first importance...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The language is consistently more ornate than the original: \"wherein the mind stands in direct relation to its object, unencumbered by inference, description, or the intervention of any further knowledge.\" The original would say this more simply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Text B frequently uses phrases like \"It is a common error to suppose...\" and \"Let us, then, examine each in turn, with that clarity which alone can dispel the confusions...\" This is more formal and self-referential than the original's straightforward exposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The section headings and elaborate structure feel like a formal academic treatise, whereas the original flows more naturally as continuous prose.\n",
      "\n",
      "**TEXT C ANALYSIS:**\n",
      "Text C also uses section headings but with a slightly less formal structure. The opening is clearer: \"At the heart of human understanding lies a fundamental distinction between two kinds of knowledge...\" This is somewhat elevated but closer to the original's directness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prose maintains a balance between formality and accessibility: \"To speak of knowledge by acquaintance is to speak of direct, unmediated awareness.\" This is more elaborate than the original but not excessively so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Text C uses concrete examples effectively, like the original: \"When we perceive an object\u2014say, a table\u2014we are not merely forming an opinion about it...\" The explanations are clear and pedagogical, though slightly more polished than the original.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rhythm and pacing are closer to the original, with a mix of simple and complex sentences. Phrases like \"This distinction is crucial\" and \"The difference between acquaintance and description can be summed up in a single word: directness\" echo the original's explanatory style.\n",
      "\n",
      "**TEXT D ANALYSIS:**\n",
      "Text D opens with: \"We are thus confronted with a fundamental division in the nature of knowledge, a bifurcation that demands our attention before any further inquiry can proceed.\" The word \"bifurcation\" and the somewhat dramatic phrasing suggest a slightly more formal tone, but the structure is similar to the original.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prose has a distinctive rhythm that closely matches the original: \"Knowledge by acquaintance is the simpler of the two, the more primitive. It is the direct apprehension of an object...\" Compare this to the original's \"knowledge by acquaintance, is essentially simpler than any knowledge of truths.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Text D uses the same kinds of qualifications and asides: \"not as things inferred, but as things immediately given,\" which mirrors the original's style of careful distinction-making.\n",
      "\n",
      "The example of the table is handled very similarly to the original: \"When I perceive a table, I am acquainted with its sense-data\u2014its color, its shape, the hardness of its surface, the smoothness of its grain\u2014not as things inferred, but as things immediately given.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The philosophical voice is measured and careful, with phrases like \"And here we come to the crux of the matter\" that echo the original's conversational-yet-philosophical tone. The sentence \"For while it may be true that in practice we never have acquaintance without some knowledge of truths, the two remain fundamentally different in their nature\" closely mirrors the original's way of making concessions while maintaining distinctions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**RANKING DECISION:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Text D captures the original's voice most faithfully\u2014the rhythm, the careful philosophical distinctions, the use of concrete examples, and the balance between accessibility and precision.\n",
      "\n",
      "Text C is second-best, maintaining clarity and pedagogical structure, though slightly more polished and formal than the original.\n",
      "\n",
      "Text B, while competent, is too formally structured with its numbered sections and too ornate in its language, reading like a more Victorian-era treatise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Text A is the least similar, with its literary flourishes, metaphorical language, and modern essay style that departs significantly from the original's straightforward philosophical exposition.\n"
