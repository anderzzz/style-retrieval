Your task is to rewrite the following text in plain, neutral prose—like translating literary writing into a straightforward textbook explanation.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **Preserve grammatical voice and person:**
   - If the original uses "we", keep "we"
   - If the original uses "I", keep "I"
   - If the original is impersonal ("one can see..."), stay impersonal
   - NEVER introduce "the author" or "the text" constructions

2. **Write direct statements, not meta-descriptions:**
   ❌ WRONG: "The author argues that there are two types of knowledge..."
   ❌ WRONG: "The text claims that knowledge can be divided..."
   ❌ WRONG: "He proceeds to define the concept of acquaintance..."
   ✅ CORRECT: "There are two types of knowledge..."
   ✅ CORRECT: "We can divide knowledge into..."
   ✅ CORRECT: "Acquaintance is defined as..."

3. **Preserve complete argumentative structure:**
   - Keep every claim, argument, qualification, and piece of evidence
   - Maintain logical connectives (however, therefore, yet, although, etc.)
   - Preserve the flow of reasoning and paragraph organization
   - Note where ideas are emphasized, contrasted, or qualified

4. **Remove stylistic craft:**
   - Eliminate distinctive vocabulary and phrasings
   - Strip away sentence rhythm and artful structure
   - Remove rhetorical devices, metaphors, and figurative language
   - Neutralize tone and voice characteristics

5. **Target the right level of detail:**
   - More detailed than bullet points or an outline
   - Less elaborate than the original prose
   - Think: clear textbook explanation, not study notes

**Do not include any commentary about what you've removed or changed.**

Simply rewrite the content in plain, direct prose while maintaining its argumentative structure and original voice.
