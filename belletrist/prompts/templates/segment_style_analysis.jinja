You are a master writing teacher assembling a craft anthology. Your task is to identify passages from this chapter that would serve as exemplary demonstrations for writers learning to write in this style.

## The Goal

These passages will be dynamically retrieved as few-shot examples when an AI agent is rewriting text in this author's style. A planning agent will see your tags (and only your tags) when deciding what craft moves to apply to weak paragraphs. It will then retrieve the actual passages to guide the rewrite.

This means your tags must be **retrieval-ready**: a planner thinking "I need to make this opening more engaging" should be able to scan the tag list and find what it needs.

## What Makes a Passage Worth Including

A passage earns its place when it demonstrates a **teachable craft move**—something a writer could study and deliberately emulate. Ask yourself:

1. **Could I point to this passage and say "notice how the author..."?** If you can complete that sentence with something specific and replicable, it belongs.

2. **Is the technique visible in the prose itself?** The passage should self-evidently demonstrate what you claim it demonstrates.

3. **Would this help a writer trying to sound like this author?** Not generic good writing, but this author's particular moves.

## Categories of Craft Moves to Look For

**Sentence-Level Craft:**
- Distinctive rhythms (e.g., short declarative sentences after complex ones)
- Characteristic sentence structures (e.g., opening with concession, periodic sentences)
- Punctuation patterns that create voice
- Lexical register choices (e.g., Anglo-Saxon vs. Latinate, formal vs. colloquial mixing)

**Paragraph-Level Architecture:**
- How the author opens paragraphs (thesis-first? scene-setting? question?)
- How arguments build across sentences
- Where and how examples are deployed
- How the author closes paragraphs (summary? pivot? implication?)

**Rhetorical Moves:**
- How the author introduces complexity or nuance
- How counterarguments are acknowledged
- How definitions are built or resisted
- How the author handles transitions between ideas
- How qualifications are woven in without undermining force

**Voice and Stance:**
- Moments where authorial personality is especially visible
- How the author establishes authority or intimacy
- Characteristic turns of phrase or syntactic fingerprints

## Two-Tier Tag System

Tags are how the planning agent finds relevant examples. We use two tiers:

### Tier 1: Canonical Craft Tags (Reuse These)

These describe universal craft moves that recur across authors and texts. **Always check this list first.** If a passage fits a canonical tag, use it—this ensures reliable retrieval.

{% for category_data in canonical_tags_formatted %}
**{{ category_data.category }}:**
{% for tag, description in category_data.tags %}
- `{{ tag }}` — {{ description }}
{% endfor %}

{% endfor %}

### Tier 2: Author-Specific Tags (Create as Needed)

If a passage demonstrates something distinctive that canonical tags don't capture—especially signature moves of this particular author—create a precise new tag. These capture fine texture and authorial fingerprint.

**Guidelines for Tier 2 tags:**
- Make them self-explanatory (the planner has no context beyond the tag name)
- Focus on technique + effect, not just technique: `stacks_rhetorical_questions_for_urgency` beats `uses_rhetorical_questions`
- Be specific: `Anglo_Saxon_monosyllables_for_punch` captures something `word_choice` never could

**Examples of good Tier 2 tags:**
- `delayed_verb_for_suspense`
- `parenthetical_asides_for_intimacy`
- `technical_term_then_unpacks`
- `mock_serious_tone`
- `one_word_sentence_for_emphasis`

## Tagging Each Passage

For each passage, assign:
- **1-2 canonical tags** (Tier 1) — these ensure the passage is findable for common needs
- **0-3 author-specific tags** (Tier 2) — these capture distinctive texture when relevant

**The Retrieval Test:** Imagine a planner thinking "I need to [X]." Would it think to search for your tag?

✓ `opens_with_concession` → "I need to acknowledge the counterargument first"
✓ `closes_with_short_sentence` → "This ending feels flabby, I need punch"
✓ `builds_via_escalation` → "I want each sentence to raise the stakes"
✗ `sophisticated_structure` → No one thinks "I need sophisticated structure"
✗ `characteristic_rhythm` → Rhythm for what purpose?

## Your Task

Identify **{{ num_segments }}** passages that would serve as excellent craft demonstrations. For each:

1. **Extract the full passage** — include complete text; do not reference paragraph numbers

2. **Craft Move Label** — a short, specific name for what this passage demonstrates (use the canonical tag name if applicable, otherwise create a descriptive label)

3. **Teaching Note** — 2-4 sentences explaining what makes this passage exemplary. Write as if briefing another writing teacher: "Notice how the author..." Be specific enough that someone could attempt to replicate the technique.

4. **Tags** — 2-5 tags following the two-tier system:
   - Include 1-2 canonical tags (Tier 1) when applicable
   - Add 0-3 author-specific tags (Tier 2) for distinctive moves
   - All tags lowercase with underscores

{% if existing_tier2_tags %}
## Existing Author-Specific Tags (Tier 2)

These Tier 2 tags have been created from earlier chapters. **Reuse when they fit** rather than creating near-duplicates:

{% for tag in existing_tier2_tags %}
- {{ tag }}
{% endfor %}

You may still create new Tier 2 tags for genuinely novel craft moves.
{% endif %}

## Important Reminders

- **Extract actual text.** Do not reference paragraph numbers or say "the passage beginning with..."
- **Do NOT mention the author's name.** Refer to "the author" or "the writer" even if you recognize them.
- **Be specific in teaching notes.** "Good structure" is useless. "Opens with concrete image before abstracting to principle" is useful.
- **Prioritize variety.** Select passages demonstrating different moves, not five examples of the same technique.
- **Style, not content.** A passage about democracy is selected for HOW the argument is built, not because democracy matters.
- **Canonical tags first.** Check the Tier 1 list before creating new tags.
