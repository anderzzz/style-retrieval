## Your Task

Rewrite the flattened content above as a complete, styled text.

**Guidelines:**
- **Apply demonstrated techniques naturally**, not mechanically
- **Preserve the original argument structure and content** from the flattened text
- **Let the diagnosis guide your overall approach** (it tells you what this text needs)
- **Use examples to learn HOW techniques work**, not to copy content or topics
- **Write as a complete flowing text** (no section labels, no bullet points unless content requires them, no meta-commentary about changes)

**Do NOT**:
- Force every technique into every paragraph
- Copy examples verbatim or mirror their content
- Add explanations of what you changed
- Use bullet points or section headers unless the flattened content explicitly requires them
- Include preambles like "Here is the rewritten text..."
