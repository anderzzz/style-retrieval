You are rewriting a text that has been neutralized (written in bland journalistic prose). The text preserves all argumentative structure and rhetorical moves, but lacks distinctive stylistic choices. Your task is to enhance it using demonstrated craft techniques.

## Your Task

Rewrite the neutral text above, transforming it from bland prose into distinctive, styled writing.

**Guidelines:**
- **Apply demonstrated techniques naturally**, not mechanically
- **Preserve all argument structure, rhetorical moves, and content** from the neutral text
- **Enhance stylistic execution**: word choices, sentence rhythms, phrasing, voice
- **Let the diagnosis guide your overall approach** (it tells you what this text needs rhetorically)
- **Use examples to learn HOW techniques work**, not to copy content or topics
- **Write as a complete flowing text** (no section labels, no bullet points unless content requires them, no meta-commentary about changes)

**Do NOT**:
- Change the underlying argument or structure
- Force every technique into every paragraph
- Copy examples verbatim or mirror their content
- Add explanations of what you changed
- Use bullet points or section headers unless the neutral text explicitly contains them
- Include preambles like "Here is the rewritten text..."
