You will evaluate four reconstructed texts against an ORIGINAL (gold standard) text.

**CRITICAL: This is a blind evaluation.** The four texts below were generated by different methods, but you do NOT know which method produced which text. You must judge each text solely on its stylistic similarity to the original, without any assumptions about how it was created.

## Your Task

Imagine you are a reader deeply familiar with this author's distinctive voice. Your question for each reconstruction is:

**"If I encountered this text in the wild, would I recognize it as being written by the same author?"**

Rank the four texts from 1 to 4 based on perceptual similarity to the original author's voice:
- **1 = Most similar** (would be hardest to distinguish from the original)
- **2 = Second most similar**
- **3 = Third most similar**
- **4 = Least similar** (feels most unlike the original author)

## How to Judge

Focus on the ineffable qualities that make a writer recognizable:

- **Does it sound like the same person?** If you read both aloud in your head, do they have the same rhythm and cadence?
- **Do the word choices feel natural?** Do they seem to come from the same mind, or do some feel stilted/mechanical?
- **Is the relationship with the reader the same?** Does the text position you (the reader) in the same way as the original?
- **Would you mistake this for the original author's work?** If you didn't know it was a reconstruction, would you be fooled?

**This is a perceptual judgment, not a feature checklist.** You are not checking whether texts have specific linguistic features. You are asking: "Which reconstruction captures the distinctive fingerprint of this author's voice?"

## Process

1. Read the ORIGINAL carefully and internalize what makes this author's voice distinctive
2. Read each reconstruction (A, B, C, D) as if encountering it fresh
3. For each, ask: "Does this feel like it was written by the same person?"
4. Rank them comparatively based on perceptual similarity (which would fool you most?)
5. Ensure each rank (1, 2, 3, 4) is used exactly once - no ties allowed

**Focus on felt similarity, not content accuracy.** The ideas should be similar (they were all given the same content), but you're judging whether the VOICE feels authentic.

## ORIGINAL TEXT (Gold Standard)

{{ original_text }}

---

## TEXT A

{{ reconstruction_text_a }}

---

## TEXT B

{{ reconstruction_text_b }}

---

## TEXT C

{{ reconstruction_text_c }}

---

## TEXT D

{{ reconstruction_text_d }}

**Your judgment must be returned as JSON with exactly these fields:**

```json
{
  "ranking_text_a": 1,
  "ranking_text_b": 3,
  "ranking_text_c": 2,
  "ranking_text_d": 4,
  "confidence": "high" | "medium" | "low",
  "reasoning": "Your detailed chain-of-thought explanation here. Explain which stylistic features led you to rank each text as you did, with specific examples from the texts."
}
```

**Requirements:**
- Each ranking must be an integer from 1 to 4
- Each number (1, 2, 3, 4) must appear exactly once
- No ties or duplicate rankings
- Your reasoning should explain the ranking order with specific stylistic observations

Think step by step about the stylistic features of each text, then provide your structured judgment.
