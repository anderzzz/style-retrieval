You are a master writing teacher assembling a craft anthology. Your task is to identify passages from this chapter that would serve as exemplary demonstrations for writers learning to write in this style.

## The Goal

These passages will be dynamically retrieved as few-shot examples when an AI agent is writing in this author's style. The agent will receive a passage along with its craft annotations, helping it understand not just WHAT to write but HOW this author constructs prose.

## What Makes a Passage Worth Including

A passage earns its place when it demonstrates a **teachable craft move**—something a writer could study and deliberately emulate. Ask yourself:

1. **Could I point to this passage and say "notice how the author..."?** If you can complete that sentence with something specific and replicable, it belongs.

2. **Is the technique visible in the prose itself?** The passage should be self-evidently demonstrating what you claim it demonstrates.

3. **Would this help a writer trying to sound like this author?** Not generic good writing, but this author's particular moves.

## Categories of Craft Moves to Look For

**Sentence-Level Craft:**
- Distinctive rhythms (e.g., short declarative sentences after complex ones)
- Characteristic sentence structures (e.g., opening with concession, periodic sentences)
- Punctuation patterns that create voice
- Lexical register choices (e.g., Anglo-Saxon vs. Latinate, formal vs. colloquial mixing)

**Paragraph-Level Architecture:**
- How the author opens paragraphs (thesis-first? scene-setting? question?)
- How arguments build across sentences
- Where and how examples are deployed
- How the author closes paragraphs (summary? pivot? implication?)

**Rhetorical Moves:**
- How the author introduces complexity or nuance
- How counterarguments are acknowledged
- How definitions are built or resisted
- How the author handles transitions between ideas
- How qualifications are woven in without undermining force

**Voice and Stance:**
- Moments where authorial personality is especially visible
- How the author establishes authority or intimacy
- Characteristic turns of phrase or syntactic fingerprints

## Chapter Text

{{ chapter_text }}

## Your Task

Identify {{ num_segments }} passages that would serve as excellent craft demonstrations. For each:

1. **Extract the full passage** (include the complete text—do not rely on paragraph indices)

2. **Craft Move Label**: A short, specific name for what this passage demonstrates (e.g., "concessive_pivot", "example_cascade", "definition_through_contrast", "rhythmic_clincher")

3. **Teaching Note**: 2-4 sentences explaining what makes this passage exemplary. Write as if briefing another writing teacher: "Notice how the author..." Be specific enough that someone could attempt to replicate the technique.

4. **Tags**: 3-6 lowercase tags for retrieval. Include both:
   - Structural tags (what the passage does): e.g., "introduces_topic", "handles_objection", "builds_definition"
   - Technique tags (how it does it): e.g., "parallel_structure", "ascending_complexity", "ironic_deflation"

## Output Format
```json
{
  "passages": [
    {
      "text": "The full extracted passage...",
      "craft_move": "concessive_opening",
      "teaching_note": "Notice how the author opens by granting substantial ground to predecessors before pivoting to critique. The concession ('Both deserved their reputation, for both repudiated many errors') establishes fairness before the 'But neither went as far...' turn. This builds authority while softening the critical blow.",
      "tags": ["opens_argument", "handles_predecessors", "concessive_structure", "balanced_judgment"]
    }
  ],
  "overall_observations": "Optional: Any patterns you notice across your selections that characterize this author's style broadly."
}
```

## Important

- **Extract the actual text.** Do not reference paragraph numbers.
- **Do NOT mention the author's name.** Refer to "the author" or "the writer" instead. Even if you recognize the author from the text or can infer their identity, maintain anonymity in your analysis. This applies to teaching notes, craft move labels, tags, and observations.
- **Be specific in teaching notes.** "Good structure" is useless. "Opens with a concrete image before abstracting to principle" is useful.
- **Prioritize variety.** Don't select five passages that all demonstrate the same move.
- **These are for style, not content.** A passage about democracy is not selected because democracy is important, but because of how the author constructs the argument about democracy.
