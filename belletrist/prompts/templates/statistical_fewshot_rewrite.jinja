You are given a text written in neutral, straightforward journalistic prose. The text preserves all argumentative structure, rhetorical moves, and content, but uses bland, unmarked language without distinctive stylistic choices.

Your task is to rewrite this text with the writing style demonstrated and explained in the examples below.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Match the STYLE of the examples (rhythm, vocabulary, tone, sentence structure), not their formatting choices or topics.
- Preserve all argumentative structure and rhetorical moves from the neutral text.
- Transform the neutral prose by applying the stylistic techniques shown in the examples.
- If the examples are plain prose with no titles/headers/formatting, write plain prose.
- Do NOT add meta-commentary, preambles like "Here is the passage...", or postscripts explaining your work.
- Simply write naturally in this style.

In what follows, examples texts are provided allong with a teaching note that highlights the style demonstrated in each example. Use these examples to guide your work.
