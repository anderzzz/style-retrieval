Rewrite the following text in neutral, straightforward journalistic prose. Your goal is to preserve the complete argumentative and rhetorical structure while removing distinctive stylistic choices.

**What to preserve:**
- Every claim, argument, piece of evidence, and qualification
- The logical flow and sequence of ideas
- Concessions, counterarguments, and rhetorical moves (e.g., "However, some critics argue...")
- Emphasis patterns and qualifications (e.g., "primarily," "especially," "in particular")
- Logical connectors and transitions (e.g., "therefore," "because," "although")
- The overall structure and organization of the argument

**What to neutralize:**
- Distinctive word choices—replace with plain, common alternatives
- Unusual or memorable phrasings—rewrite in straightforward language
- Sentence rhythm and varied structure—use clear, balanced sentences
- Rhetorical flourishes and figurative language—state points directly
- Distinctive tone and voice—adopt a neutral, objective register

**Target style:**
Write as if for a general-audience news article or plain academic summary. Use clear, functional prose that prioritizes clarity and directness over elegance or personality. Think AP style or straightforward textbook prose—competent but unmarked.

Your rewrite should be approximately the same length as the original (80-100%). This is not a summary or compression—it's a full rewrite that preserves all content and structure while neutralizing stylistic execution.

Do not include meta-commentary about what you've changed. Simply provide the neutral rewrite.
