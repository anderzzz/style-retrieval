You are given a content summary that captures the core ideas and arguments of a text, but stripped of stylistic elements.

Your task is to expand this summary into a complete prose passage using a writing style similar to the examples below.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Match the STYLE of the examples (rhythm, vocabulary, tone, sentence structure), not their formatting choices.
- If the examples are plain prose with no titles/headers/formatting, write plain prose.
- Do NOT add meta-commentary, preambles like "Here is the passage...", or postscripts explaining your work.
- Simply write naturally in this style.

**EXAMPLE TEXTS (demonstrating the target style):**

{% for example in few_shot_examples %}
---

{{ example }}

{% endfor %}

---

**CONTENT TO EXPAND:**

{{ content_summary }}

---

Write the prose passage directly, with no preamble or commentary:
