    "# Style Evaluation: Few-Shot Source Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook evaluates how the **source of few-shot examples** affects style reconstruction quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "When using few-shot prompting to reconstruct style, does it matter whose writing we use as examples?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "For each gold standard text (Bertrand Russell):\n",
    "1. **Flatten**: Extract content while removing style\n",
    "2. **Reconstruct**: Generate text using 4 different few-shot sources (M stochastic runs each):\n",
    "   - Russell (same author - baseline)\n",
    "   - Chesterton (different author)\n",
    "   - Clausewitz (different author, different domain)\n",
    "   - Hume (different author, same domain - philosophy)\n",
    "3. **Judge (Blind Comparative)**: Judge ranks all 4 reconstructions based on similarity to original\n",
    "   - **Blind evaluation**: Judge sees only anonymous labels (Text A, B, C, D)\n",
    "   - **Ranking**: 1 = most similar, 4 = least similar\n",
    "   - **Order randomized**: Position of methods varies across samples\n",
    "4. **Aggregate**: Analyze rankings to determine which few-shot source works best\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect Russell examples (same author) to perform best, but want to quantify:\n",
    "- How much worse are other authors?\n",
    "- Does domain similarity (Hume - philosophy) matter more than authorship?\n",
    "- Can cross-author examples still capture some style elements?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Crash resilient**: All LLM responses saved to SQLite immediately\n",
    "- **Resume support**: Can restart after failures, skips completed work\n",
    "- **Blind evaluation**: Eliminates judge bias by hiding method names\n",
    "- **Comparative ranking**: More informative than binary comparisons"

      "Let me analyze each text's stylistic similarity to the original by focusing on the distinctive voice and rhythm.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Original's distinctive features:**\n",
      "- Direct, clear philosophical prose with measured cadence\n",
      "- Uses \"we shall\" constructions naturally and frequently\n",
      "- Employs parenthetical clarifications smoothly (e.g., \"of the kind we call knowledge by _acquaintance_\")\n",
      "- Has a conversational yet authoritative tone - speaks directly to reader\n",
      "- Uses concrete examples (the table) embedded naturally in the argument\n",
      "- Balanced sentence structure - neither overly ornate nor overly plain\n",
      "- Natural transitions like \"But first of all we must make clear\"\n",
      "- Phrases like \"strictly speaking\" and \"as opposed to\" feel organic\n",
      "- The voice is pedagogical but not condescending\n",
      "\n",
      "**Text A Analysis:**\n",
      "This text has a distinctly different rhythm. It opens with \"The author begins by dividing\" - immediately creating distance by referring to \"the author\" in third person, which the original never does. The prose is more formal and elaborate: \"On the one side stand the things that we know; on the other, the truths that we know about them.\" This has an almost archaic, literary quality with its inverted construction. Phrases like \"within the seemingly simple realm\" and \"more primitive and more fundamental\" feel heavier than the original's style. The text uses constructions like \"Yet, while this logical independence is insisted upon\" which are more passive and formal than the original's direct voice. Overall, this reads like commentary ON the original rather than the original voice itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Text B Analysis:**\n",
      "This immediately feels closer to the original. \"The author begins by cutting knowledge cleanly in two\" - while it still uses third person, the phrase \"cutting knowledge cleanly in two\" has a more direct, vivid quality. The voice here is conversational: \"Its business is with things only\" and \"One might, in bare theory, imagine a creature acquainted with things to which no single proposition was ever attached—no 'it is brown,' no 'it is large,' not even a timid 'it exists.'\" That phrase \"not even a timid 'it exists'\" has personality and wit that feels authentic to philosophical writing of this era. The rhythm feels right: \"It lives and moves and has its being in propositions\" - this has the balanced cadence of the original. However, the consistent third-person framing throughout creates some distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Text C Analysis:**\n",
      "This text has a more stripped-down, outline-like quality at times: \"There are, he tells us, two great provinces: first, knowledge of things; second, knowledge of truths.\" The enumerated structure and formal organization feels slightly mechanical. Phrases like \"In the present chapter, the second province is laid aside\" are clear but lack the natural flow of the original. The text uses \"the author\" throughout, maintaining distance. However, when it gets into the philosophical content, it does capture some of the original's clarity: \"For the colour, as given, is already wholly there.\" The style is competent and clear but feels more like a careful paraphrase than the original voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Text D Analysis:**\n",
      "This text has the most elaborate, formal style: \"on the one side, knowledge of things; on the other, knowledge of truths. In the present chapter, he confines himself wholly to the former. Yet even within this narrower territory he finds it necessary to distinguish anew, and marks off two subordinate regions.\" The vocabulary choices like \"confines himself wholly,\" \"narrower territory,\" \"distinguish anew,\" and \"subordinate regions\" feel more elevated and archaic than the original. Phrases like \"lest his doctrine be carried beyond its due bounds\" and \"in the case of human beings as they actually are\" have a Victorian formality. \"They stand, as it were, face to face with the mind\" - this metaphorical elaboration goes beyond the original's style. The whole text reads like a 19th-century philosophical treatise, more ornate than the original.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Ranking Decision:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The original uses first-person plural (\"we shall say,\" \"we have seen\") throughout, creating direct engagement with the reader. All four reconstructions switch to third person (\"the author\"), which immediately creates distance. However, I must rank them by which BEST captures the voice despite this limitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Rank 1 (Most similar): Text B**\n",
      "Despite the third-person framing, Text B best captures the original's conversational rhythm, natural phrasing, and balanced cadence. Phrases like \"cutting knowledge cleanly in two\" and \"not even a timid 'it exists'\" show personality. The flow feels most natural.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Rank 2 (Second): Text C**\n",
      "Clear and competent, though somewhat mechanical in places. It maintains the philosophical precision without excessive ornamentation, staying closer to the original's directness than A or D.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Rank 3 (Third): Text A**\n",
      "More elaborate and literary than the original, with heavier constructions and a more formal tone. It reads like sophisticated commentary rather than the original voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Rank 4 (Least similar): Text D**\n",
      "The most ornate and archaic style, with Victorian formality that goes well beyond the original's measured clarity. Phrases like \"lest his doctrine be carried beyond its due bounds\" feel from a different era or style entirely.\n"

      "The author begins by dividing what is commonly called “knowledge” into two great provinces. On the one side stand the things that we know; on the other, the truths that we know about them. For the moment, he is concerned only with the former. Yet even here, within the seemingly simple realm of “knowledge of things,” a further distinction appears. There is, first, that knowledge which comes through immediate presence, and which he calls knowledge by acquaintance; and there is, secondly, that knowledge which comes mediated by some characterization or formula, which he calls knowledge by description.\n",
      "\n",
      "Knowledge by acquaintance, he maintains, is both more primitive and more fundamental than any knowledge of truths. It is, in its own nature, simpler than judgment, and, in strict logic, owes nothing to propositions or inferences. In principle, it does not presuppose that we know anything true or false about the object of acquaintance. Yet, while this logical independence is insisted upon, a caution is added. It would be misleading to suggest that human beings as they are ever in fact enjoy acquaintance wholly divorced from any accompanying beliefs. In practice, wherever we have acquaintance, we almost always also have some fragment of knowledge of truths concerning what we are acquainted with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Knowledge by description, on the other hand, is of a different sort. It is never naked, never self-sufficient; it always presupposes the possession of certain truths. These truths form its source and support, and the author proposes, in due course, to make explicit how this dependence works. But before that is possible, the terms “acquaintance” and “description” themselves must be clarified.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are said to have acquaintance with anything of which we are directly aware. Direct awareness, in this sense, excludes both inference and presupposition of propositions; it is a matter of sheer presence to consciousness. When, for example, the author stands before a table, what he is immediately conscious of is not the physical table as physics or common sense imagines it, but a collection of sense-data—its colour, its shape, its hardness, its smoothness, and so forth. These several features form the content of his direct awareness in seeing and touching. They are the items of which he is at that very moment conscious, and for that reason they are the things with which he is acquainted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider, for instance, the particular shade of colour that appears. About this one may make any number of statements: that it is brown, that it is rather dark, that it is more or less uniform, and so on. Such assertions, when true, constitute knowledge of truths concerning the colour. But they do not add anything to, nor do they refine, the author’s knowledge of the colour itself as the object given in acquaintance. So far as knowing the colour itself goes—as something present, seen, immediately there—his knowledge is complete and exhaustive in the mere seeing. Beyond that direct awareness, no further knowledge of the colour, considered as the very object with which he is acquainted, is even in principle attainable. One may multiply predicates without end, but the acquaintance is as full in the first moment as in the last.\n",
      "\n",
      "From this example the general character of sense-data, as they here concern us, may be gathered. The coloured expanse, the felt resistance, the visible outline, and the rest of what composes the appearance of the table are objects of acquaintance. They are given just as they are, directly and without intermediary, and are thus immediately known.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when we pass from these appearances to the table conceived as an independent physical object, the situation is altered. Our knowledge of the table itself is not of the same immediate kind. We do not find the table, as a physical thing persisting in space, thrust upon us in simple presence. Rather, we reach it by way of the sense-data; we infer or suppose a thing which stands behind them, or is their cause, or in some other way accounts for them. Our relation to the table as a physical object is therefore not acquaintance, but something more indirect.\n",
      "\n",
      "This difference emerges with particular clarity if we recall a point established earlier. There is no contradiction in doubting that the physical table exists; various hypotheses can be framed that dispense with it. But the same cannot reasonably be said of the sense-data: that there is now a brownish patch seen, a certain hardness felt, and so on, is not, in the same way, open to doubt. Here, at least, something is directly before the mind. The table, as a physical object, is not thus secured.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly, the author places his knowledge of the table under the head of knowledge by description. To know the table is, in this sense, to know it as “the physical object which causes such-and-such sense-data,” or by some similar phrase. The name “table” here attaches, not to an object directly present, but to whatever it is that fulfils a certain role indicated by a descriptive formula. The description points to the thing via the appearances; it takes as its starting point those sense-data with which we are acquainted, and then characterizes that which, we suppose, stands in a certain relation to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order, therefore, to know anything whatever about the table, more is required than the bare existence of sense-data. We must possess some truths which link the table to those items of acquaintance—truths, for example, of the general form: “Such-and-such sense-data are caused by a physical object.” Our belief that there is a table, and that it has certain properties, rests upon beliefs of this causal or structural sort. Without such truths, the sense-data would remain as isolated givens; we should not thereby so much as arrive at the notion of a table.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author denies that there is any state of mind in which we are, in strictness, directly aware of the physical table itself as we are of its colour or hardness. Everywhere, where the table as a physical thing is concerned, our knowledge takes the form of truths—statements to the effect that a certain physical object stands in such-and-such relations to such-and-such sense-data. The table as it is in itself—if we speak rigorously—is never simply given to us. It is, rather, something reached by thought, posited as the unique satisfier of a description.\n",
      "\n",
      "What, then, do we positively have in such a case? We have, first, a certain description. Secondly, we know—or believe we know—that there exists exactly one object to which this description applies. But the object so singled out is not itself present in the way in which its appearances are. It is not something with which we are acquainted; it is only something whose existence and certain of whose characteristics we assert in propositional form.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever our relation to an object is of this structure—whenever, that is to say, we know it only as “that which satisfies such-and-such a description,” without direct awareness of the object itself—our knowledge is what the author calls knowledge by description.\n",

      "The author begins by cutting knowledge cleanly in two. On one side stand things; on the other, truths. This chapter will not concern itself with truths at all, except insofar as they creep in by necessity. Its business is with things only; and even here there is a further division: a man may know a thing by being acquainted with it, or he may know it only by description.\n",
      "\n",
      "Knowledge by acquaintance, the author maintains, is of a different order from any knowledge of truths. It is, so to speak, more primitive, more rudimentary; simpler in its essence and independent in its logic. One might, in bare theory, imagine a creature acquainted with things to which no single proposition was ever attached—no “it is brown,” no “it is large,” not even a timid “it exists.” But though this logical independence is insisted on, there is, at once, a caution added: it would be going much too far to say that human beings, as a matter of plain psychological fact, ever do in practice have acquaintance with anything without also knowing something true about it. The independence is a matter of logical structure, not a report about our everyday mental life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Knowledge by description, on the contrary, cannot so much as begin without truths. It lives and moves and has its being in propositions, and they serve it both as source and as foundation. The author promises, in the rest of the chapter, to make this dependence very exact; but first he must say what is meant by “acquaintance” and by “description.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We are said to be acquainted with whatever we are directly aware of. Direct awareness means awareness that does not come to us second-hand through an argument, nor hangs upon some chain of reasoning, nor leans for support upon any prior stock of truths. It is not a matter of inferring that a thing is there; it is simply being confronted with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make this less abstract, the author turns to a table. Sitting before it, he finds himself acquainted not (as yet) with some occult “real table,” but with the sense-data which compose its appearance to him—the particular patch of colour, the spread of shape, the felt hardness, the smoothness his fingers report, and so on. These are what he is immediately conscious of when he looks and when he touches; they are, in this basic sense, the things with which he has acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Take, for instance, the specific shade of colour that presents itself to his eyes. That shade can be made the subject of a whole string of statements: he can say “it is brown,” “it is rather dark,” “it is less red than that other patch,” and a hundred other such things. Each of these belongs to the realm of truths; each is a proposition that may be asserted or denied. In piling them up he may be enormously increasing his stock of knowledge-about—the truths he knows regarding the colour. But he is not, by the same stroke, improving his knowledge of the colour itself in the sense of acquaintance. In so far as that colour is considered as a bare object of direct awareness, he already has it, entire and complete, in the simple seeing of it. Beyond that immediate presence, there is, in principle, no further acquaintance with it to be had.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, as concerns acquaintance, the sense-data which constitute the look and feel of the table are wholly given. They are, each of them, objects of acquaintance, and they are known, in that way, just as they stand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very different is the case of the table as a physical object. The author’s relation to the table, in this guise, is not a matter of direct awareness. Whatever he knows of it, he knows only by means of his acquaintance with the sense-data which parade as its appearance. Elsewhere, he has already taken pains to show—and he here reminds us—that while one can, without contradiction, raise doubts about the existence of the physical table, one cannot, in the same fashion, doubt the existence of the sense-data. You may be wrong about what causes such-and-such a patch of brown or such-and-such a sensation of hardness; but you cannot be wrong that there is, just now, this patch and this sensation before your mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "This difference leads him to class his knowledge of the table itself, the supposed physical thing out there, as knowledge by description.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the table can be caught in a descriptive net, as when one calls it “the physical object which causes such-and-such sense-data.” In speaking so, one reaches the table only by way of the sense-data; the description uses as its stepping-stones those very things with which we are acquainted.\n",
      "\n",
      "If, then, we are to know anything about the table, certain conditions must be satisfied. We must have at our disposal some truths which tie the table to items of acquaintance. In particular, we must, in some sense, accept a proposition of the form: “these sense-data are caused by a physical object.” That truth, if truth it is, links what is given to what is merely supposed.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is, according to the author, no mental state in which the table, as a physical object, itself stands before us with the same naked immediacy as its colour or its hardness. We are never, strictly speaking, directly aware of it. All that we have with respect to the table is a bundle of truths: that certain sense-data are grouped together, that their occurrence has such and such regularities, that it is convenient or explanatory to say that there is one physical object which is the cause of them, and so forth. The thing which, in this talk, is called “the table” is, in the strict sense, never given; it is reached only through these truths.\n",
      "\n",
      "What we do possess is a description which we understand. We know that there is exactly one object to which that description applies, and we know that whatever satisfies it is what we intend by “the table.” But that object itself does not come before us in acquaintance; it is not included among the things directly revealed.\n",

      "Whenever our knowledge of some object has this form—when we know a certain description, we know that some unique thing answers to it, and we yet lack any direct awareness of that thing as it is in itself—our knowledge of that object belongs to the second class. It is not knowledge by acquaintance, but knowledge by description.\n",

      "\n",
      "first, knowledge of things;\n",
      "second, knowledge of truths.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the present chapter, the second province is laid aside. Only knowledge of things is to be treated; and even within this narrower field, a further distinction is to be drawn. Knowledge of things is of two kinds:\n",
      "\n",
      "knowledge by acquaintance,\n",
      "and knowledge by description.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of these two, knowledge by acquaintance is said to be, in its essence, simpler than any knowledge of truths, and, in point of logic, entirely independent of such knowledge. Yet here at once a limitation must be added. Although acquaintance does not presuppose the possession of truths, it would probably be false to maintain that human beings in fact ever stand in mere naked acquaintance with anything without at the same time knowing at least some truth concerning it. The independence is logical, not psychological.\n",
      "\n",
      "Knowledge by description, on the other hand, is of a different character. It always presupposes some knowledge of truths. These truths are not something accidental or external; they are its very source and foundation. How this is so will be made clear in the sequel. For the moment, the author confines himself to fixing the meaning of the two central notions: “acquaintance” and “description.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Acquaintance, to begin with, is defined as follows. We are acquainted with anything of which we are directly aware. This direct awareness excludes all mediation by inference; it does not come to us as a conclusion drawn from premises, nor does it lean upon any prior store of truths. Where there is such direct awareness, there is acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "An example is offered. When one is standing before a table, one is acquainted, not with a mere word or a conjecture, but with the sense-data that constitute the table’s appearance: its colour, its shape, its hardness, its smoothness, and so forth. These are what one is immediately conscious of in seeing and touching the table. They are not inferred; they are simply given. These sense-data, therefore, are things with which one is acquainted.\n",
      "\n",
      "The example is then pressed further. Consider the particular shade of colour that appears. About this shade, various statements can be framed: “it is brown,” “it is rather dark,” and the like. Such statements yield knowledge of truths about the colour. They articulate properties, they classify, they compare. But however numerous and precise these statements become, they do not enlarge or refine one’s knowledge of the colour itself, insofar as the colour is taken as the object of immediate awareness. For the colour, as given, is already wholly there.\n",
      "\n",
      "With respect to the colour itself, and not to the truths that may be stated about it, seeing it suffices for complete acquaintance. There is, as far as acquaintance goes, no room for an “increase”; there is no further possible knowledge of the colour itself beyond this direct seeing. To be acquainted with it is, in this sense, to know it fully and completely as the object it is in acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "From this example the conclusion is drawn that the sense-data composing the appearance of the table are objects of acquaintance. They are immediately known, and they are known just as they are, in their givenness, not through propositions but prior to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over against this stands our knowledge of the table as a physical object. Here the situation is quite different. This knowledge is not direct. It is won, if at all, by means of our acquaintance with the sense-data that make up the table’s appearance. Earlier it was shown—and the point is now recalled—that we can, without contradiction, doubt the existence of the table as a physical object. We may suppose, for example, that there is no such external thing corresponding to our appearances. But we cannot, in the same way, cast doubt upon the existence of the sense-data themselves; they are not, in that manner, open to sceptical suspension.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly, the author classifies his knowledge of the table as knowledge by description.\n",
      "\n",
      "The table, as a physical object, does not enter directly into awareness; it is reached only through a characterisation. We may, for instance, describe it as “the physical object which causes such-and-such sense-data.” This descriptive phrase does not touch the table immediately; it points to the table by way of the sense-data. It is constructed out of items with which we are acquainted, and uses these as its material.\n",
      "\n",
      "To know anything about the table on this basis, certain conditions must be fulfilled. We must, first of all, possess some truths that connect the table with our items of acquaintance. In particular, we must know something of the form: “Such-and-such sense-data are caused by a physical object.” Only in virtue of such a truth can the description “the physical object which causes these sense-data” come to denote anything for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author insists that there is no mental state in which we are directly aware of the table itself as a physical object. Nowhere do we find the table present in consciousness in the manner of its colour or its hardness. All our knowledge of the table is thus knowledge of truths—truths, for example, about what causes which sense-data, about the regularities of these causal connexions, about their continuities and changes. The table itself, as the thing supposed to lie behind these appearances, is, strictly speaking, not directly given.\n",
      "\n",
      "What we do possess, in such cases, is a certain description. We are acquainted with the sense-data; we know certain truths uniting them under a common cause; from these we fashion a phrase which picks out “the physical object which…” and so on. We know, moreover, that there is exactly one object to which this description applies. But that object is not itself an item of acquaintance. It is reached only by the route of description.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, then, where our knowledge of an object has this form—where we know a description that uniquely belongs to it, and know that there is one and only one thing answering to that description, yet are not directly aware of the thing itself—our knowledge is what the author calls knowledge by description.\n",

      "The author begins by dividing the whole field of knowing into two great provinces: on the one side, knowledge of things; on the other, knowledge of truths. In the present chapter, he confines himself wholly to the former. Yet even within this narrower territory he finds it necessary to distinguish anew, and marks off two subordinate regions: first, that knowledge which arises from acquaintance; secondly, that which springs from description.\n",
      "\n",
      "Concerning knowledge by acquaintance he lays down two principal theses. First, that it is in its very nature more primitive and simple than any knowledge that takes the form of a truth or proposition. Secondly, that it stands logically independent of such propositional knowledge, in the sense that its possibility does not presuppose any earlier store of truths. At the same time, he is careful to add a limitation, lest his doctrine be carried beyond its due bounds. Although acquaintance does not, in strict logic, require any prior knowledge of truths, it would yet be rash to affirm that, in the case of human beings as they actually are, we ever meet with a pure and isolated acquaintance that is not accompanied by some belief or judgment concerning the object. The logical independence remains; the psychological separation is at least doubtful.\n",
      "\n",
      "With knowledge by description, the situation is precisely the reverse. Here the author maintains that such knowledge is never found except as resting upon, and composed out of, knowledge of truths. These truths form at once its source and its foundation; and it is his declared intention, in the sequel of the chapter, to exhibit this dependence in detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order that his discourse may proceed without ambiguity, he next undertakes to determine what is meant by “acquaintance” and what by “description.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As to acquaintance, he defines it thus. We are said to have acquaintance with any object of which we are directly aware. By direct awareness is to be understood a kind of mental presence which is free from two sorts of mediation. It is not the remote outcome of any process of reasoning or inference; nor does it wait upon our possessing any truth or proposition about the thing so known. Where there is inference, or dependence upon previous judgments, there is no longer pure acquaintance, but something more complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make this more vivid, he turns to a familiar example. Let us suppose him in the presence of a table. In such a case he is acquainted, not with some hidden essence lying behind appearances, but first and foremost with the sense-data that together constitute what we call the table’s look and feel—its colour, its shape, its hardness, its smoothness, and such other sensible characters as may be presented. These are items of which he is immediately conscious in the very act of seeing and touching. They stand, as it were, face to face with the mind, and in this direct confrontation they are the proper objects of acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "He then bids us consider more narrowly one portion of this sensible manifold: the particular shade of colour which at the moment meets the eye. Concerning this shade a variety of statements may be made: we may say “it is brown,” “it is rather dark,” and many other like propositions. By affirming such things, we undoubtedly acquire knowledge of truths about the colour; we bring it under some more general conception, we assign it a place among other colours. Yet all this leaves untouched, and in no way amplifies, our knowledge of the colour itself so far as it is the immediate object of acquaintance. To see the shade once, with full consciousness, is to have all the acquaintance with it that is possible in principle. No multiplication of true statements respecting it, however subtle, can make that acquaintance either more complete or more perfect; they only build, as it were, a superstructure of truths upon a basis that was already entire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence the author is led to the following conclusion. As regards the colour itself, taken precisely as that which is given to sight, he possesses, by the mere act of seeing, a knowledge that is complete and admits of no intrinsic increase. The same holds of the other elements of the table’s appearance. The sense-data which together compose this appearance are objects of acquaintance, and as such are immediately known just as they are, without the interposition of judgment or inference.\n",
      "\n",
      "He now opposes to this direct acquaintance with sense-data our knowledge of the table as a physical object. Here, he says, our situation is altered. We do not find in ourselves any immediate awareness of the table itself considered as a material thing existing in space. Whatever we know of it in this character is obtained only by means of, and through our acquaintance with, the sense-data that manifest it. Earlier in the discussion, he had already insisted that it is possible, without contradiction, to raise a doubt whether any physical table corresponding to our perceptions exists at all, whereas it is not similarly possible to doubt the existence of the sense-data themselves, so long as they are before the mind. The sense-data thus enjoy a certainty and directness which the supposed physical object lacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly, he places our knowledge of the table, taken as a physical object, under the head of knowledge by description.\n",
      "\n",
      "In such a case, the table is characterized, not by being immediately presented, but by being picked out through some phrase of a descriptive sort; for example, as “the physical object which causes such-and-such sense-data.” The office of this description is to refer us, by way of the sense-data with which we are acquainted, to something beyond our immediate awareness. The description is, as it were, a bridge thrown from the domain of acquaintance to that of unobserved reality; and it plainly depends upon the items of acquaintance for its meaning and application.\n",
      "\n",
      "For us to know anything at all about the table, in so far as it is conceived as a physical thing, certain conditions must therefore be fulfilled. We must possess, first, some body of truths connecting the table with objects of which we are directly aware. In particular, we must at least know a proposition of the form: “Such-and-such sense-data are caused by a physical object.” Without some such linkage in the form of a truth, we should be unable to pass from what is given in acquaintance to the table itself, and the descriptive phrase would lack any definite reference.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author further contends that there is, in strictness, no mental state in which we are directly and immediately aware of the table itself as that physical object which we presume to exist. Whenever we speak of our knowledge of the table, what we really possess is a set of truths—truths, for instance, about which sense-data depend causally upon which physical source. The thing that is the table, regarded as an existent in the external world, is not, he tells us, among the things directly present to our consciousness.\n",
      "\n",
      "What, then, do we have in such a case? We have, first, acquaintance with certain sense-data. Beyond this, we possess knowledge of a description: we know that there exists an object which uniquely satisfies the description “the physical object causing these and those sense-data.” We may even be assured that there is exactly one such object. Yet that very object, which the description singles out, is not itself given to us in direct awareness; it is reached only through the descriptive truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, whenever our knowledge of some supposed object assumes this form—namely, that we are acquainted, not with the object itself, but only with certain data, and we know a description which is true of one and only one object connected with those data—our knowledge is to be called knowledge by description.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Topic and historical context**\n",
      "\n",
      "   - The author examines changes in educational theory over time by comparing earlier influential works with more recent views.\n",
      "   - John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau are identified as the two main pre-19th-century reformers in educational theory.\n",
      "   - Both are credited with challenging many widely accepted errors of their time, so their importance is acknowledged.\n",
      "   - However, the author claims that, relative to current views, both fall short in how far they carry their own principles.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Locke and Rousseau’s limitations regarding democracy**\n",
      "\n",
      "   - Both thinkers are placed within a broader intellectual movement that tended toward liberalism and democracy.\n",
      "   - Despite this, each of them focuses only on the education of a single aristocratic boy receiving the full-time attention of one tutor.\n",
      "   - The author notes that this model might produce excellent results for the individual but is inherently limited in scope.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Argument about universality and arithmetic impossibility**\n",
      "\n",
      "   - The author argues that, from a modern standpoint, this tutor-intensive aristocratic model is not seriously acceptable.\n",
      "   - Reason: It is mathematically impossible for every child to receive the undivided attention of a full-time adult tutor.\n",
      "   - Therefore, such a method is structurally restricted to a privileged class.\n",
      "   - In a just social order, an educational system that presupposes such privilege could not exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Modern democratic criterion for educational theory**\n",
      "\n",
      "   - The author states that contemporary thinkers, in theory, do not regard an educational problem as solved by any method that cannot, at least in principle, be available to everyone (or to all who have the capacity to benefit from it).\n",
      "   - There is an explicit distinction between:\n",
      "     - Practical behavior of individuals (parents may still seek extra advantages for their own children under current conditions).\n",
      "     - Theoretical standard for judging educational systems (they should be potentially universal).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Clarification about not sacrificing current opportunities**\n",
      "\n",
      "   - The author qualifies the democratic principle with a practical caveat:\n",
      "     - People who are well-off should not, under existing imperfect conditions, give up educational advantages for their own children just because these advantages are not currently available to all.\n",
      "   - Reason given: Doing so would amount to letting concerns about justice override the preservation and transmission of civilization.\n",
      "   - So, while the long-term goal is a just and universal system, there is a distinction between the ideal we aim at and what individuals should do in present circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Statement of the future ideal**\n",
      "\n",
      "   - The target for future educational systems is defined as follows: every boy and girl should have access to the best educational opportunities that exist.\n",
      "   - The ideal system is explicitly stated to be democratic.\n",
      "   - The author adds that this ideal is not immediately achievable but should guide planning and evaluation.\n",
      "   - The author assumes that, in the present time, this broad democratic aim would receive wide agreement among educationists.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Guiding principle for the author’s own proposals**\n",
      "\n",
      "   - The author declares that democracy, in this sense of potential universality, will be kept in view throughout the discussion.\n",
      "   - Any educational arrangements the author supports will be ones that can, in principle, be extended to everyone.\n",
      "   - However, the author again qualifies this by stating that, meanwhile, an individual should not deliberately subject their own children to inferior common standards if they can secure something better.\n",
      "   - This is presented as a very limited commitment to democratic principle—one that accepts universality as a theoretical criterion but allows individual exceptions in practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Critique of Locke and Rousseau on this point**\n",
      "\n",
      "   - The author claims that even this minimal democratic consideration (potential universality plus present individual exceptions) is missing in Locke and Rousseau.\n",
      "   - Rousseau is singled out: although he rejects aristocracy as a political principle, he fails to recognize what that rejection should imply for educational theory.\n",
      "   - Implicit argument: A consistent rejection of aristocracy should push one toward educational arrangements not restricted to an elite.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Need for clarity about democracy in education**\n",
      "\n",
      "   - The author stresses that precise thinking is needed about how democracy should apply to education.\n",
      "   - There is a warning against an interpretation of democracy that would impose complete uniformity on all students and teachers.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Recognition of differences in ability and resources**\n",
      "\n",
      "    - The author states that some children are more intellectually able than others and can benefit more from advanced education.\n",
      "    - Some teachers are better prepared or more naturally gifted than others.\n",
      "    - It is impossible for every student to be taught by the small number of best teachers.\n",
      "    - The author raises the possibility (and personal doubt) that even if the highest form of education were desirable for everyone, such universal access is not currently feasible.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. **Warning against a crude or mechanical egalitarianism**\n",
      "\n",
      "    - A certain simplistic application of democratic principles might argue: if not all can receive the highest education now, then none should.\n",
      "    - The author condemns this conclusion.\n",
      "    - If such a view were implemented:\n",
      "      - It would seriously damage scientific progress.\n",
      "      - It would unnecessarily lower the general educational level a century from now.\n",
      "    - The argument: Equality enforced by leveling down can harm long-term advancement.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. **Proposed approach to educational democracy**\n",
      "\n",
      "    - The author argues that progress must not be sacrificed to a rigid form of equality at the present moment.\n",
      "    - Instead, the move toward democratic education should be gradual and careful.\n",
      "    - The aim in this transition is to remove inequality while preserving as much as possible of the valuable outcomes that have, historically, been tied to unjust social structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "13. **Criterion of potential universality for evaluating methods**\n",
      "\n",
      "    - The author states that no educational method should be considered satisfactory if it is inherently impossible for it ever to be applied to everyone.\n",
      "    - As an example of current inequality:\n",
      "      - Children of wealthy families often have the attention of several adults (mother, nurse, nurserymaid, and other servants), providing a level of individual attention impossible to extend to all children in any social order.\n",
      "    - The author questions whether intensive care of this sort benefits children, suggesting it might foster undue dependency.\n",
      "    - Regardless, the author asserts that, except where there are specific justifying reasons (e.g., severe cognitive limitations or exceptional talent), no fair-minded observer can endorse special educational advantages reserved for a small group.\n",
      "\n",
      "14. **Role of parents and experimentation**\n",
      "\n",
      "    - The author describes what a prudent parent is likely to do now:\n",
      "      - Seek a form of education for their children that, in practice, is not yet universal.\n",
      "    - The author approves of allowing parents the freedom to try new educational methods because experimentation is necessary to discover improvements.\n",
      "    - However, a constraint is added:\n",
      "      - These experimental methods should be such that, if they prove successful, they could be made available to everyone.\n",
      "      - They should not be methods that, by their structure or resource requirements, must remain exclusive to a privileged minority.\n",
      "\n",
      "15. **Examples of democratic origins in modern education**\n",
      "\n",
      "    - The author notes that some of the most valuable aspects of contemporary educational theory and practice originated in strongly egalitarian contexts.\n",
      "    - A specific example is given: Maria Montessori’s work, which began in nursery schools in poor urban areas.\n",
      "    - This example is used as evidence that high-quality educational innovation can emerge from settings serving disadvantaged populations.\n",
      "\n",
      "16. **Higher education and exceptional ability**\n",
      "\n",
      "    - For advanced levels of education, the author maintains that special opportunities for those with exceptional talent are essential.\n",
      "    - Thus, differentiation based on ability at higher levels is defended as necessary, not as an unjust privilege.\n",
      "\n",
      "17. **Final generalization about universality**\n",
      "\n",
      "    - Apart from the case of higher education for exceptional ability, the author concludes that there is no valid reason why any child should lose out if society adopts educational systems that are, in principle, extendable to everyone.\n",
      "    - Implicit argument: Well-designed, broadly applicable systems can serve both fairness and quality, provided special provisions are made where genuinely required (e.g., for genius or for significant disability).\n",

    "## Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Does same-author few-shot win?** \n",
    "   - Compare Russell vs. all other sources\n",
    "   - Expected: Russell should rank highest on average\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Does domain matter more than author?**\n",
    "   - Compare Hume (philosophy) vs. Chesterton/Clausewitz (different domains)\n",
    "   - If Hume ranks higher than others, domain similarity helps\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How much worse are cross-author examples?**\n",
    "   - Mean rank difference between Russell and next-best\n",
    "   - Practical significance: is cross-author few-shot viable?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Are some authors actively harmful?**\n",
    "   - Check if any method consistently ranks 3rd or 4th\n",
    "   - Suggests stylistic mismatch is worse than no examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Statistical significance testing (Friedman test for rankings)\n",
    "- Pairwise comparisons (Russell vs. each other source)\n",
    "- Qualitative review of reconstructions\n",
    "- Analyze judge reasoning for insights"
