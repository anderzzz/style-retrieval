    "# Style Evaluation: Few-Shot Source Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook evaluates how the **source of few-shot examples** affects style reconstruction quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "When using few-shot prompting to reconstruct style, does it matter whose writing we use as examples?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "For each gold standard text (Bertrand Russell):\n",
    "1. **Flatten**: Extract content while removing style\n",
    "2. **Reconstruct**: Generate text using 4 different few-shot sources (M stochastic runs each):\n",
    "   - Russell (same author - baseline)\n",
    "   - Chesterton (different author)\n",
    "   - Clausewitz (different author, different domain)\n",
    "   - Hume (different author, same domain - philosophy)\n",
    "3. **Judge (Blind Comparative)**: Judge ranks all 4 reconstructions based on similarity to original\n",
    "   - **Blind evaluation**: Judge sees only anonymous labels (Text A, B, C, D)\n",
    "   - **Ranking**: 1 = most similar, 4 = least similar\n",
    "   - **Order randomized**: Position of methods varies across samples\n",
    "4. **Aggregate**: Analyze rankings to determine which few-shot source works best\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect Russell examples (same author) to perform best, but want to quantify:\n",
    "- How much worse are other authors?\n",
    "- Does domain similarity (Hume - philosophy) matter more than authorship?\n",
    "- Can cross-author examples still capture some style elements?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Crash resilient**: All LLM responses saved to SQLite immediately\n",
    "- **Resume support**: Can restart after failures, skips completed work\n",
    "- **Blind evaluation**: Eliminates judge bias by hiding method names\n",
    "- **Comparative ranking**: More informative than binary comparisons"

      "Let me analyze the distinctive voice of the original text first. The author writes with:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **A measured, philosophical tone** - careful qualifications like \"I think, would, nowadays, be pretty generally conceded\" and \"I do not mean that... What I do mean is...\"\n",
      "2. **Direct, conversational clarity** - addresses the reader directly with phrases like \"I shall keep democracy in view\" and \"Whatever I shall advocate\"\n",
      "3. **Balanced, practical argumentation** - consistently weighs competing concerns (justice vs. civilization, ideals vs. practice)\n",
      "4. **Straightforward sentence structure** - mostly clear, readable sentences without excessive ornamentation\n",
      "5. **A distinctive rhythm** - uses repetition for emphasis (\"Some boys and girls... Some teachers...\") and natural-sounding transitions\n",
      "\n",
      "Now examining each reconstruction:\n",
      "\n",
      "**TEXT A:** This text has a markedly different voice. It opens with \"Whoever compares, with any degree of attention, the more eminent writings of former ages\" - this is more formal and archaic than the original's \"In reading even the best treatises.\" Throughout, it uses elaborate 18th-century-style constructions: \"withstood, each in his fashion, a host of grave and inveterate prejudices,\" \"It is refuted, not by subtlety, but by arithmetic,\" \"an appanage of privilege.\" The voice sounds like it's *imitating* an older educational theorist, not like the original's modern, accessible philosophical voice. Phrases like \"Let us suppose, if you will\" and \"We must beware of drawing from this consideration\" feel stilted and overly formal. This is the least similar to the original's natural, conversational tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "**TEXT B:** This text has energy and personality. It opens with vivid imagery: \"grave and faded pages,\" \"They smote, each in his way, a whole forest of errors.\" It uses striking metaphors: \"It is an idyll; it is not a plan for a people,\" \"preferring a barren and immediate equality,\" \"cut off his children's nose to spite the face of society.\" The voice is more colorful and rhetorically dramatic than the original. While engaging, it feels like a different personality - someone more flamboyant and literary. Phrases like \"the educational romances of Locke and Rousseau\" and \"the worship of uniformity\" show a writer with a more poetic sensibility than the original's measured philosophical approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "**TEXT C:** This text captures the original's measured, careful tone very well. It opens similarly: \"If we turn back to even the most admirable of the older writings on education, we can see at once that the whole outlook has undergone a profound transformation.\" The rhythm and pacing feel right. It maintains the original's careful qualifications: \"though very likely to seek, in fact, exceptional advantages,\" \"I think, would now be admitted with tolerable unanimity.\" The sentence structures are clear and straightforward, matching the original's accessibility. The transitions are natural, and the voice maintains that same balanced, philosophical quality throughout. This feels like the same mind at work.\n",
      "\n",
      "**TEXT D:** This text is competent but slightly more formal than the original. Opening with \"Whoever turns back to the best writings\" is more formal than the original's \"In reading even the best treatises.\" The phrasing throughout is slightly stiffer: \"divide between them almost all enlightened revolt,\" \"rendered real service,\" \"counts the theoretical problem of education as solved.\" While not as archaic as Text A, it lacks the original's conversational ease. Phrases like \"in this renunciation demands when we come to consider\" and \"From a rough and thoughtless interpretation\" feel less natural than the original's flow. It's closer to the original than A or B, but not quite capturing the same voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Ranking Decision:**\n",
      "- **Text C (Rank 1):** Most faithful to the original's measured, conversational philosophical voice\n",
      "- **Text D (Rank 2):** Competent but slightly more formal; captures much of the spirit but with less naturalness\n",
      "- **Text B (Rank 3):** Engaging but too colorful and literary; a different personality\n",
      "- **Text A (Rank 4):** Too formal and archaic; feels like pastiche of 18th-century prose rather than the original's modern voice\n"

They both deserved their influence, because they rejected many serious and widespread errors of their time. However, neither followed his own principles as far as most modern educationists now do. Both contributed to the movement that led toward liberalism and democracy, yet both focus only on the education of a single aristocratic boy, taught by one man who devotes all his time to him.\n",

Such a system can exist only for a privileged class; in a just society, it could not exist at all. The modern person, although likely to seek special advantages for his or her own children in practice, does not regard the theoretical problem of education as solved except by some method that could be available to everyone, or at least to everyone whose abilities make it possible for them to benefit from it.\n",

Doing that would put the goal of justice above the maintenance of civilization. It does mean that the educational system we should aim to establish in the future is one that gives every boy and girl a chance at the best that exists. The ideal educational system must be democratic, even though this ideal cannot be fully realized at present. This point would now, I think, be quite widely accepted. In this sense, I shall keep democracy in mind. Whatever I recommend will be something that could in principle be made universal, although, in the meantime, an individual should not deprive his or her children because of the poor quality of what is generally available, if he or she has the intelligence and the opportunity to obtain something better. Even this very limited form of democratic principle is missing from Locke’s and Rousseau’s educational writings. Although Rousseau rejected aristocracy, he did not understand what this rejection implied for education.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the relation between democracy and education, it is important to be clear. It would be very harmful to insist on complete uniformity. Some boys and girls are more able than others and can gain more from higher education. Some teachers are better trained or more naturally gifted than others, but it is impossible for everyone to be taught by the few best teachers. Even if the highest kind of education were desirable for all, which I doubt, it is not currently possible for all to receive it. A crude application of democratic ideas might then suggest that no one should receive it. If adopted, this view would be disastrous for scientific progress and would make the general level of education a hundred years from now unnecessarily low. We should not sacrifice progress to a rigid equality in the present. We must move toward educational democracy carefully, trying to avoid destroying, in the process, valuable results that have so far been connected with social injustice.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, we cannot accept as satisfactory any method of education that could not possibly be extended to all. The children of rich families often have, in addition to their mother, a nurse, a nurserymaid, and partial attention from other domestic servants; this results in a degree of attention that could never, under any social system, be given to all children. It is very doubtful whether children who are looked after so carefully really benefit from being made needlessly dependent, but in any case no impartial person can approve special advantages for a minority, except in special cases such as intellectual disability or exceptional talent.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sensible parent today will probably, if possible, choose for his or her children some educational method that is not yet universal, and for purposes of experiment it is good that parents should be able to try new methods. But these methods should be such that they could be made universal if they prove successful, not such that they must, by their nature, be restricted to a privileged few. Fortunately, some of the best features of modern educational theory and practice have arisen from very democratic conditions; for instance, Madame Montessori’s work began in nursery schools in poor districts. In higher education, special opportunities for special ability are essential, but apart from that, there is no reason why any child should be harmed by the adoption of educational systems that could be made available to all.\n",

      "If we turn back to even the most admirable of the older writings on education, we can see at once that the whole outlook has undergone a profound transformation. Before the nineteenth century, the two men who chiefly stand out as innovators are Locke and Rousseau. They both earned their influence, for they swept aside a number of grave and widely‑accepted blunders of their age. Yet neither of them pursued his own principles so far as they would now be carried by most contemporary educationists. Each, in his way, contributed to the current that was ultimately to swell into liberalism and democracy; yet each, in practice, is occupied with a single aristocratic boy, educated in solitude by a solitary man who dedicates his whole life to this one pupil.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever the intrinsic merits of such a system, no one with a modern outlook can now regard it as a serious solution, for the simple reason that arithmetic is against it. It is a physical impossibility that every child should enjoy the undivided attention of an adult tutor. Such an arrangement can exist only for a privileged caste; in a society that deserved to be called just, it could not exist at all. The modern man or woman, though very likely to seek, in fact, exceptional advantages for his or her own offspring, does not consider the theoretical problem of education as solved except by some method that could be made accessible to all, or at any rate to all whose native powers fit them to profit by it.\n",
      "\n",
      "This does not entail that, at the present moment, the well‑to‑do ought to renounce any educational advantage which happens not to be open to everybody. To insist upon this would be to place the abstract aim of equality above the very concrete necessity of keeping civilization alive. What it does entail is that the educational system which we ought to seek to create is one that will give to every boy and girl an opportunity of reaching whatever is best that the world contains. Such a system, in its ideal form, must be democratic, though we may be compelled for a long time to acquiesce in a very partial realization of the ideal. This much, I think, would now be admitted with tolerable unanimity. It is in this sense that I shall bear democracy in mind. Whatever I propose will be something which could, in principle, be universalized, although meanwhile no individual ought to deprive his or her children of an available advantage on the ground that it is not yet obtainable by all, if he or she has the wit and the means to secure it. Even this very modest application of democratic doctrine is absent from the educational writings of Locke and Rousseau. Rousseau, though he repudiated aristocracy, failed to perceive what this repudiation involved in the sphere of education.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the connection between democracy and education it is important to avoid confusion. Nothing could be more disastrous than to insist upon a dead level of complete uniformity. Some boys and girls are more capable than others, and are able to derive greater benefit from prolonged and intensive study. Some teachers, by training or by natural aptitude, are incomparably better than others; but it is plainly impossible that all children should sit at the feet of the few best teachers. Even if the very highest type of education were equally desirable for everyone—which I, for my part, do not believe—it is certainly not at present possible to provide it for all. A crude and literal‑minded application of democratic sentiment might then suggest that, since the best cannot be for everyone, it ought to be for no one. If this doctrine were adopted, the effect upon science would be disastrous, and the general level of education, a century hence, would be kept artificially and quite avoidably low. We must not immolate future progress upon the altar of an immediate and rigid equality. Our advance toward educational democracy must be cautious; we must endeavour, as we move, not to destroy those valuable achievements which, so far, have unfortunately been allied with social injustice.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, we cannot regard as ultimately satisfactory any educational method which, by its very nature, could never be made accessible to all. The children of the prosperous commonly enjoy, besides their mother, the services of a nurse, a nurserymaid, and such incidental attentions as other domestics may bestow; thus they receive a degree of personal care which, under no conceivable social order, could be extended to every child. It is highly doubtful whether those who are so sedulously watched and tended gain, in the end, from the unnecessary dependence thus fostered; but in any case no impartial observer can approve special advantages for a small minority, except in the very definite instances of intellectual deficiency or of quite exceptional talent.\n",
      "\n",
      "A reasonably judicious parent in our own day will probably, if the circumstances permit, choose for his or her children some type of schooling that is not yet in universal use; and from the standpoint of experiment it is well that parents should enjoy this liberty to make trials. But the experiments ought to be of a kind that could, if they succeed, be generalized; they should not be such that, by their intrinsic character, they must always remain the monopoly of a favoured few. It is one of the happier features of the present situation that many of the best elements in modern educational theory and practice have sprung from extremely democratic surroundings; Madame Montessori, for example, began her work in nursery schools in poor neighbourhoods. In the sphere of higher education, special provisions must certainly be made for special ability; but apart from that, there is no valid ground for allowing any child to suffer because we have adopted types of educational organization that are, in their nature, capable of being conferred upon all.\n",

      "When we turn over the grave and faded pages of the old masters of education, even the best of them, we are conscious at once that something immense has happened since their time. The very air is different. Locke and Rousseau stand out as the great reformers before the nineteenth century, and they earned their fame. They smote, each in his way, a whole forest of errors that had been growing thick and poisonous for generations. Yet, having hewn their way so far, they both stopped short at the edge of the clearing. They did not follow their own principles into the open country where most modern educationists—rightly or wrongly—have tried to travel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both were heralds of the new liberal and democratic spirit; both helped to batter down the doors of hereditary privilege. Yet, when they came to the practical question of how to rear a human being, each pictured, not a nation of children, but one solitary boy; not a society, but a pair of figures in a garden—the tutor and his pupil. One child, one man, one lifetime given up to him. It is an idyll; it is not a plan for a people.\n",
      "\n",
      "However admirable its results might be for that one fortunate soul, no one who has really grasped the modern problem can now regard such a scheme as more than a fairy-tale. It breaks down, not merely on sentiment, but on arithmetic. It is simply not possible that every child should have the undivided services of a grown man. This is not only socially unjust; it is numerically absurd. The system, by its very structure, belongs to a class apart; in any society that took justice seriously, it would not merely be rare, it would be inconceivable. The modern man, for all his private inconsistency and parental cunning in seeking some extra advantage for his own offspring, does not suppose for a moment that he has “solved” the problem of education unless his solution is something that can be offered, at least in theory, to everybody—or, to be more exact, to everybody whose brains and character give them the power to profit by it.\n",
      "\n",
      "This does not, of course, require us to indulge in a suicidal heroism and demand that the well-to-do, here and now, throw away such educational opportunities as fortune has placed within their reach because these are not yet within the reach of all. That would mean preferring a barren and immediate equality to the continued existence of the very civilization which alone could ever make equality tolerable or valuable. It does mean that the system at which we are aiming, the thing we are consciously trying to build, must be one in which every boy and every girl can have his or her chance at the best that is known and done among us. In principle, the ideal must be democratic, even if our practice limps behind. On this point, I think, there is by now a fairly general consent. In this sense—and in this sense only—I shall keep democracy continually before me. Whatever I advocate will be something which could, in the nature of the case, be made universal. Meanwhile the individual parent is not bound, in a fit of abstract righteousness, to cut off his children’s nose to spite the face of society. If he has wit enough and opportunity enough to find for them something better than the average, he is not morally obliged to condemn them to the average because the average is bad. Even this very modest and tentative conception of democracy is entirely absent from the educational romances of Locke and Rousseau. Rousseau repudiated the old aristocracy, but he never quite saw what such a repudiation must mean when you come to the schoolroom door.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this matter of democracy and education, we must be sharply precise. Nothing could be more ruinous than to turn democracy into the worship of uniformity. Children differ; they differ deeply and incurably. Some boys and girls are abler than others and can draw richer nourishment from higher studies. Teachers differ as much as pupils. Some are born with the gift of teaching, or have laboriously acquired it; others never will. It is impossible that all children should sit daily at the feet of the few who are supremely great in the craft. Even if the very highest type of education were equally desirable for every living child—which I, for one, very gravely doubt—it is at present quite impossible to provide it for every living child. A crude and clumsy interpretation of democratic doctrine might then whisper that, if the best cannot be given to all, it had better be given to none. This counsel, if followed, would be fatal. It would paralyse scientific discovery, and would deliberately drag down the general level of knowledge, a century hence, to something pitiably lower than it need be. We have no right to fling the future into the furnace in order to warm ourselves at the little blaze of a momentary and mechanical equality. Our business is to move towards educational democracy with caution, preserving, so far as we can, every fragment of real excellence that has, up to now, been entangled with social injustice, and disentangling it instead of destroying it.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, we must not pretend to be satisfied with any method of education which, by its very constitution, could never be spread to all. Look, for example, at the situation in many wealthy homes. The child of such a house often has, not a mother alone, but a nurse, a nurserymaid, and, besides these appointed guardians, the minute fragments of attention dropped upon it from the over-full hands of various other servants. The result is a concentration of care which can never, under any imaginable social system, be granted to the mass of mankind. It is extremely doubtful whether the child is the better for all this fussy guardianship; indeed, it is highly probable that the elaborate supervision only succeeds in manufacturing a quite gratuitous helplessness. But whether the result is good or bad, no impartial mind can regard as permanently admissible a luxury in nurture which must of necessity be confined to a small minority—unless we are dealing with those exceptional cases where extra help is plainly needed, as in grave intellectual disability, or evidently justified, as in quite extraordinary gifts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reasonable parent of our own day will, in fact, very likely choose for his children, if he can, some method of schooling which is not yet widely used; and it is an excellent thing that such experiments should be possible. Progress in education, as in anything else, depends largely upon intelligent ventures and carefully watched novelties. But there is a vital proviso. These experiments must be of a kind that could, if they succeed, be thrown open to the whole population. They must not be of a kind which, by a sort of built-in aristocracy, must always remain the perquisite of a few. It is one of the happier facts of recent history that some of the soundest and most fruitful ideas in modern education have sprung up, not in gilded nurseries, but in the humblest and most democratic surroundings. Madame Montessori did not begin in palaces; she began in the nursery schools of poor quarters.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the higher stages of learning, special doors must be opened for special abilities; without such doors a society condemns its finest minds to stagnation and wastes its rarest powers. But, apart from this straight and narrow path for the particularly able, there is no reason why any child should have his life cramped or his character distorted merely because we have adopted, as the backbone of our system, those forms of education which could, if we chose, be extended to all. The point is not that everyone should be dragged up to the same level, but that every level we deliberately maintain should be one on which, in principle, any child might stand.\n",

      "Whoever turns back to the best writings of an earlier age on the subject of education can at once perceive that opinion has since undergone a serious transformation. Before the nineteenth century two names divide between them almost all enlightened revolt against traditional practice: Locke and Rousseau. Their authority was, on the whole, well earned; they attacked grave and wide-spread errors, and in doing so rendered real service. But neither of them pressed his own principles to the point at which most modern students of education now find themselves compelled to carry theirs. Both helped to prepare the way for liberalism and democracy; yet each, in his educational Utopia, is concerned with one solitary boy of good family, in the hands of one devoted preceptor who has no business in life but to form this single soul.\n",

      "Whatever the excellence of the product, no one who thinks in modern terms can now accept such a scheme as a serious solution. The arithmetical difficulty alone is fatal. It is simply impossible that every child should enjoy the exclusive and continuous services of an adult tutor. Such an arrangement can belong only to a privileged class; in a society which had really become just, it would have no place at all. The modern man or woman, however much in practice he or she may contrive peculiar advantages for his or her own offspring, does not count the theoretical problem of education as solved by any plan that is, in its very nature, confined to a minority. A method is counted satisfactory only if, at least in principle, it might be open to all, or at any rate to all whose capacities are such that they can profit by it.\n",

      "From this it does not follow that those who are now well-to-do are under some immediate obligation to refuse for their children any opportunity that the poor cannot yet share. To insist on that would be to sacrifice the preservation of civilisation to an abstract formula of justice. What it does mean is that the system at which we ought to aim is one providing for every boy and every girl a chance of the best that human experience has so far devised. The ideal scheme of education must be democratic in its intention, though we may know perfectly well that its ideal cannot now be wholly realised. On this point there would now, I think, be a very wide agreement; and in this sense I shall keep democracy constantly before me. Whatever I advocate will be something which might, in principle, be made universal, even though, in the interval, no parent is bound to let his or her children suffer the shortcomings of the common provision, if intelligence and opportunity allow something better. Even this very modest form of democratic requirement is absent from the educational writings of Locke and Rousseau. Rousseau, indeed, threw aside aristocracy; but he failed to see what this renunciation demands when we come to consider the upbringing of the young.\n",
      "\n",
      "The connection between democracy and education must, however, be rightly conceived. A crude demand for sameness everywhere would be gravely mischievous. Boys and girls differ in power; some are capable of benefiting far more than others from prolonged or higher studies. Teachers likewise differ; some are better prepared, others possess a natural gift for the work; but it is plainly impossible that all children should sit at the feet of the few best. Even if one granted that the very highest type of education was suitable for every mind, which I do not, we are not in a position, as things stand, to offer it to all. From a rough and thoughtless interpretation of democratic principle there springs the suggestion that, since this best is impossible for everyone, it should therefore be allowed to no one. To adopt such a view would be to strike at the roots of scientific progress, and to condemn the average level of education, a century hence, to an unnecessary and deplorable mediocrity. We must refuse to immolate the future to a stiff and lifeless equality in the present. The advance toward a democratic education must be conducted with circumspection, and we must be on our guard, in levelling old distinctions, not to destroy along with them the genuine gains that have hitherto been allied with social injustice.\n",

The children of the rich not infrequently enjoy, besides their mother’s care, that of a nurse, a nurserymaid, and a certain share of attention from other domestic servants; and in this way they obtain a quantity of personal supervision which no conceivable social order could ever make universal. It is, to say the least, doubtful whether this sedulous tending is really good for them; there is every reason to fear that it fosters a dependence which is wholly needless. But whatever may be its intrinsic value, no disinterested observer can approve such purely adventitious advantages for a minority, except in those special and recognisable cases where they are required by intellectual disability or justified by quite exceptional talent.\n",

In this respect we are fortunate. Many of the soundest achievements of contemporary theory and practice have grown up under frankly democratic conditions; Madame Montessori’s work, for example, took its rise in nursery schools established in poor quarters. In the sphere of higher education special facilities for special ability are indispensable; but apart from the provision thus required by genuine differences of capacity, there is no ground whatever for supposing that any child need suffer because we decide to adopt forms of schooling which, as means and as methods, could be brought within the reach of all.\n",

      "Whoever compares, with any degree of attention, the more eminent writings of former ages upon education with those which have appeared in our own time, will soon perceive that opinion has undergone very considerable alterations. Before the nineteenth century, the two chief innovators in this field were Locke and Rousseau. Their authority was well earned; for they withstood, each in his fashion, a host of grave and inveterate prejudices. Yet though they shook the fabric of the old doctrine, they did not build up the new so far as their own principles would have carried them, and much less so far as our present theorists are prepared to go. Both, beyond question, contributed powerfully to that general movement which has issued in liberal institutions and democratic sentiment; but both, when they come to the concrete problem, confine themselves to imagining the education of a single boy of rank, placed under the exclusive guidance of one preceptor, whose whole life is absorbed in this solitary task.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us suppose, if you will, that such a plan should attain in the individual case the happiest results; it still cannot for a moment be entertained by anyone who reasons in the spirit of our age. It is refuted, not by subtlety, but by arithmetic. It is simply not possible that every child should enjoy the undivided attention of a private tutor. Such an arrangement is of its essence an appanage of privilege; and in a community that aimed seriously at justice, its existence would be as intolerable in practice as it is inconceivable in theory. The contemporary mind—even though, in its conduct as a parent, it is apt enough to secure for its own offspring all the peculiar advantages it can—does not hold that the general problem of education is solved save by a method which could, in principle, be shared by all, or at least by all whose natural capacities render them fit to profit by it.\n",

      "We must beware of drawing from this consideration a conclusion which would, if adopted, be fatal. It does not follow that, in the present imperfect order of things, the wealthy are bound to renounce those educational conveniences which cannot yet be placed within universal reach. To act thus would be to prefer the abstract idea of justice to the very existence of the civilization in which alone that idea has any meaning. What does follow is that the system we ought to keep before us, as that toward which we should progressively approximate, must be one in which every boy and every girl has access to whatever is best in the educational art. The ideal system must be democratic in its structure and intention, though the complete realization of such an ideal be for the moment beyond our powers. So much, I believe, would now be granted by a large proportion of thoughtful persons; and it is in this restricted but important sense that I shall hereafter use the word democracy. Whatever I may commend will be something which, so far as its nature is concerned, could at length be made common to all; although meanwhile no parent ought, on democratic scruples, to withhold from his children such superior teaching as he has the discernment to value and the means to secure, merely because the systems now in general use are of poor quality. Even this modest application of the democratic principle is wholly absent from the writings of Locke and Rousseau upon education. Rousseau, it is true, rejected the privileges of birth; but he did not perceive what consequences for the training of the young were necessarily involved in that repudiation.\n",

      "On the connexion between democracy and education it is highly necessary that we should think with precision. Nothing could be more pernicious than to identify democracy with an absolute uniformity in educational arrangements. Children differ widely in their native powers; some are capable of receiving, and of profitably assimilating, a far more extended instruction than others. Teachers too are very unequal, whether by natural gifts or by acquired skill; and it is a physical impossibility that every pupil should sit at the feet of that select minority who are especially fitted for the work. Even if we were to assume, what seems to me extremely doubtful, that the very highest and most exacting type of education would be suitable for all without exception, we are at present quite unable, in point of material resources, to bring such a type within universal reach. A rough and ill-considered use of democratic sentiment might then suggest the conclusion that, since all cannot enjoy the best, therefore none ought to do so. Were such a doctrine to gain practical authority, the effect upon the progress of science and the general improvement of mankind would be calamitous. The intellectual level of the community, a century hence, would be kept artificially and needlessly low. We must not immolate the future to a barren equality in the present. Our advance towards an educational democracy must be gradual and cautious, and must sedulously avoid the destruction, by some rude levelling process, of those higher developments of culture which, however unjustly distributed, have hitherto been associated with inequality of condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, while we refuse to confound democracy with a mechanical sameness, we are equally precluded from acquiescing in any scheme of education which, from its very nature, cannot by any possibility be extended to the whole population. Consider, for example, the typical environment of a child in a wealthy household. Besides the mother, there is commonly a nurse, a nursery-maid, and, in addition, a certain share of attention from other domestics. The amount of personal service and incessant supervision thus bestowed creates a degree of solicitude which could never, under any conceivable social organization, be made common to all children. It is at best a monopoly of a small class. It is, indeed, very doubtful whether these elaborately tended infants derive from such assiduous care anything but an increased helplessness and an unnecessary dependence upon others. But however that may be, no impartial observer can approve, as a permanent arrangement, advantages of this sort for a few, save in those exceptional instances—such as serious mental defect or extraordinary genius—where special treatment is required in the interest of the individual and of society alike.\n",
      "\n",
      "A prudent parent in our own day will, if he has the means, probably seek out for his children some mode of instruction which has not yet become the common rule, and there is nothing but good to be said for a certain measure of experiment of this kind. It is well that new methods should be put to the test of actual use, and parents may, within reasonable limits, serve as the pioneers of improvement. But the experiments in question ought to be restricted to methods which, should they justify themselves by their fruits, are capable of indefinite extension, and not to devices which, from their very constitution, must remain the prerogative of a small and favoured circle. It is a fortunate circumstance that some of the best elements in modern doctrine and practice have sprung from conditions which were in a high degree democratic. The work of Madame Montessori may be cited as an instance: it took its origin, not among the children of the rich, but in infant schools established in poor districts. In the sphere of higher learning, it will always be necessary to provide peculiar facilities for those of unusual ability; here inequality of treatment is not only innocent but indispensable. Apart from this, however, there is no shadow of reason why any child should be injured or stinted by the adoption of such educational arrangements as can, without intrinsic contradiction, be made the common heritage of all.\n",

      "When we read even the best earlier works on education, we can see that educational theory has changed in important ways. Before the nineteenth century, the two major reformers in this area were Locke and Rousseau. They both deserved their influence, because they rejected many serious and widespread errors of their time. However, neither followed his own principles as far as most modern educationists now do. Both contributed to the movement that led toward liberalism and democracy, yet both focus only on the education of a single aristocratic boy, taught by one man who devotes all his time to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "However good such a system might be in its results, no one with a modern outlook could now consider it seriously, because it is mathematically impossible for every child to have the full-time attention of an adult tutor. Such a system can exist only for a privileged class; in a just society, it could not exist at all. The modern person, although likely to seek special advantages for his or her own children in practice, does not regard the theoretical problem of education as solved except by some method that could be available to everyone, or at least to everyone whose abilities make it possible for them to benefit from it.\n",
      "\n",
      "This does not mean that, here and now, the well-to-do should give up educational opportunities that are currently not available to all. Doing that would put the goal of justice above the maintenance of civilization. It does mean that the educational system we should aim to establish in the future is one that gives every boy and girl a chance at the best that exists. The ideal educational system must be democratic, even though this ideal cannot be fully realized at present. This point would now, I think, be quite widely accepted. In this sense, I shall keep democracy in mind. Whatever I recommend will be something that could in principle be made universal, although, in the meantime, an individual should not deprive his or her children because of the poor quality of what is generally available, if he or she has the intelligence and the opportunity to obtain something better. Even this very limited form of democratic principle is missing from Locke’s and Rousseau’s educational writings. Although Rousseau rejected aristocracy, he did not understand what this rejection implied for education.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the relation between democracy and education, it is important to be clear. It would be very harmful to insist on complete uniformity. Some boys and girls are more able than others and can gain more from higher education. Some teachers are better trained or more naturally gifted than others, but it is impossible for everyone to be taught by the few best teachers. Even if the highest kind of education were desirable for all, which I doubt, it is not currently possible for all to receive it. A crude application of democratic ideas might then suggest that no one should receive it. If adopted, this view would be disastrous for scientific progress and would make the general level of education a hundred years from now unnecessarily low. We should not sacrifice progress to a rigid equality in the present. We must move toward educational democracy carefully, trying to avoid destroying, in the process, valuable results that have so far been connected with social injustice.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, we cannot accept as satisfactory any method of education that could not possibly be extended to all. The children of rich families often have, in addition to their mother, a nurse, a nurserymaid, and partial attention from other domestic servants; this results in a degree of attention that could never, under any social system, be given to all children. It is very doubtful whether children who are looked after so carefully really benefit from being made needlessly dependent, but in any case no impartial person can approve special advantages for a minority, except in special cases such as intellectual disability or exceptional talent.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sensible parent today will probably, if possible, choose for his or her children some educational method that is not yet universal, and for purposes of experiment it is good that parents should be able to try new methods. But these methods should be such that they could be made universal if they prove successful, not such that they must, by their nature, be restricted to a privileged few. Fortunately, some of the best features of modern educational theory and practice have arisen from very democratic conditions; for instance, Madame Montessori’s work began in nursery schools in poor districts. In higher education, special opportunities for special ability are essential, but apart from that, there is no reason why any child should be harmed by the adoption of educational systems that could be made available to all.\n",

    "## Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Does same-author few-shot win?** \n",
    "   - Compare Russell vs. all other sources\n",
    "   - Expected: Russell should rank highest on average\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Does domain matter more than author?**\n",
    "   - Compare Hume (philosophy) vs. Chesterton/Clausewitz (different domains)\n",
    "   - If Hume ranks higher than others, domain similarity helps\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How much worse are cross-author examples?**\n",
    "   - Mean rank difference between Russell and next-best\n",
    "   - Practical significance: is cross-author few-shot viable?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Are some authors actively harmful?**\n",
    "   - Check if any method consistently ranks 3rd or 4th\n",
    "   - Suggests stylistic mismatch is worse than no examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Statistical significance testing (Friedman test for rankings)\n",
    "- Pairwise comparisons (Russell vs. each other source)\n",
    "- Qualitative review of reconstructions\n",
    "- Analyze judge reasoning for insights"
